Task:
Normalize the Big Ideas / Themes section into a consistent tabular format.

Rules:
- Use ONLY text present in the document.
- Preserve wording exactly (no paraphrasing).
- Do NOT summarize, infer, or add content.
- Output ONE Big Idea per line.
- ALWAYS output exactly THREE TAB-SEPARATED columns in this order:
	Big Idea ID<TAB>Big Idea Name<TAB>Big Idea Description

Definitions:
- Big Idea ID:
	- Use the short identifier found in parentheses, if present (e.g., "VAR", "UNC", "DAT").
	- If no parenthetical identifier exists in the document, output an EMPTY string.
- Big Idea Name:
	- The title of the idea (e.g., "VARIATION AND DISTRIBUTION", "EVOLUTION").
	- Do NOT include the words "BIG IDEA", numbers, or parenthetical identifiers.
- Big Idea Description:
	- ALL descriptive sentences associated with the idea.
	- Preserve sentence order and wording exactly.

Formatting rules:
- If the title and description appear on the same line, split them logically.
- If the document does not explicitly separate title and description:
	- Treat the first sentence as the name.
	- Treat all remaining sentences as the description.
- Do NOT include headers, footers, page numbers, or navigation text.
- Do NOT include explanations or commentary.
- Return plain text only.
