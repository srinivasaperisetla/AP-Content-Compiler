Task:
Normalize the AP Exam Sections into a strict tabular format.

Rules:

- Use ONLY the main question format for the section
  (e.g., "Multiple Choice", "Free Response", "Short Answer").
- Do NOT use sub-question labels as question types.

Output format:
- Output ONE logical row per line.
- Use TAB characters.
- ALWAYS output exactly SIX columns in this order:

	Section<TAB>Question Type<TAB>Number of Questions<TAB>Exam Weighting<TAB>Timing<TAB>Description Line

Description rules:
- Each descriptive paragraph or bullet must be output as its OWN row.
- Repeat the first five columns for each description line.
- If a field is not explicitly stated, output an EMPTY string.
- Make sure to capture all instructions needed to provide context into what each section consists of what it focuses on etc.. without leaving details. 

Do NOT include:
- Headers or footers
- Page numbers
- Navigation text
