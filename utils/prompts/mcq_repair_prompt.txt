REPAIR TASK
The previous generation produced validation errors. Generate exactly {{ num_questions }} REPLACEMENT questions.

COMMON VALIDATION ERRORS TO AVOID:
{{ error_summary }}

CRITICAL REMINDERS:
- Generate COMPLETE questions (not partial fixes)
- Use ONLY these allowed skills: {{ allowed_skills_preview }}
- Use ONLY these allowed LOs: {{ allowed_los_preview }}
- Follow TSV format EXACTLY (no deviations)

VALID TSV EXAMPLE (for reference):
easy	1.A,2.B	VAR-1.A,VAR-1.B	0	A researcher tests $H_0: \mu = 50$ versus $H_a: \mu > 50$ with $\alpha = 0.05$. The $p$-value is 0.03. What conclusion should be made?	Reject $H_0$	Fail to reject $H_0$	Accept $H_0$	The test is inconclusive	none	

Note: Above has 11 columns separated by TABS (not spaces). Column order: diff, skill_codes, lo_ids, correct_idx, stem, A, B, C, D, stim_type, stim_payload

OUTPUT (STRICT TSV)
- EXACTLY {{ num_questions }} lines
- NO header, NO blank lines, NO extra text
- Each line MUST have 11 TAB-separated columns in THIS EXACT ORDER:

diff	skill_codes	lo_ids	correct_idx	stem	A	B	C	D	stim_type	stim_payload

COLUMN RULES

diff:
- easy | medium | hard

skill_codes:
- Comma-separated
- ALL codes MUST be from ALLOWED_SKILLS in unit context
- At least one required

lo_ids:
- Comma-separated
- ALL IDs MUST be from ALLOWED_LOS in unit context
- At least one required

correct_idx:
- 0 | 1 | 2 | 3  (A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3)

stem:
- Clear AP-style question stem
- No explanations
- Avoid explicit references to answer choices unless standard AP style requires it

A, B, C, D:
- Plain text only
- NO labels
- EXACTLY ONE correct
- Never put tables or images inside A/B/C/D. If visual content is needed, set stim_type=image and provide a detailed description in stim_payload.

stim_type:
- none | image
- If visual content is needed (chart, table, diagram, molecular structure, circuit, etc.), use "image"

====================
MATHEMATICAL NOTATION
====================

- ALL mathematical expressions MUST use LaTeX format
- Inline math: $expression$ (e.g., $\alpha$, $H_0: p = 0.75$, $\hat{p}$)
- Display math: $$expression$$ (for larger equations on separate line)
- Common symbols:
  * Greek: $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\mu$, $\sigma$, $\pi$
  * Operators: $\ge$, $\le$, $\ne$, $\pm$, $\times$, $\div$
  * Stats: $\bar{x}$, $\hat{p}$, $s^2$, $\sqrt{n}$, $\frac{a}{b}$
  * Subscripts/superscripts: $x_i$, $n^2$
- Examples:
  * GOOD: "Test $H_0: p = 0.75$ versus $H_a: p < 0.75$"
  * GOOD: "If $n\hat{p} \ge 10$ and $n(1-\hat{p}) \ge 10$, then..."
  * GOOD: "The test statistic is $\frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}}$"
  * BAD: "Test H_0: p = 0.75 versus H_a: p < 0.75"
  * BAD: "(x - mu) / (s / sqrt(n))"

====================
IMAGE PROMPT FORMAT (STRICT)
====================

If stim_type = image, provide a detailed prompt describing the image to generate in stim_payload.

FORMAT: IMAGE_PROMPT: [detailed description]

CRITICAL IMAGE RULES (AP EXAM STANDARDS):
✗ DO NOT describe images that include question text
✗ DO NOT describe images that include answer choices (A/B/C/D)
✗ DO NOT describe images with question-related titles/captions
✓ DO describe standalone visual stimuli: diagrams, charts, graphs, data tables, scenarios
✓ DO include only labels that identify parts of the diagram/data (e.g., axis labels, force vectors, chemical structures)
✓ The image should be something students look at TO ANSWER a question, not something that CONTAINS the question

Write prompts like a creative director: be highly detailed and visually striking.
Be specific about: layout, labels, values, colors, style, atmosphere, composition, specific visual elements.

GOOD IMAGE PROMPT EXAMPLES:
• "IMAGE_PROMPT: Create a highly detailed bar chart showing test scores in a clean, professional academic style. X-axis displays students labeled A through E. Y-axis ranges from 0 to 100 with clear gridlines. Five vertical bars with heights corresponding to values: A=85, B=72, C=93, D=68, E=88. Use a professional color palette suitable for educational materials with good contrast and readability. NO title, NO question text, NO explanatory captions - just the pure data visualization."

• "IMAGE_PROMPT: Create a professional data table with clear gridlines. Column headers: Year, Revenue (thousands), Profit (thousands). Four data rows: 2020: 100, 20 | 2021: 150, 35 | 2022: 200, 50 | 2023: 180, 40. Use clean typography with good contrast. This is raw data for students to analyze - NO titles, NO question references, NO interpretive text."

IMPORTANT:
- For tables in images, describe all data clearly in natural language
- For mathematical content in images, write out formulas in natural language (e.g., "n hat p greater than or equal to 10")
- Be comprehensive - the image generator needs all details

====================
stim_payload rules
====================

- If stim_type = none → MUST be empty
- If stim_type = image → must start with "IMAGE_PROMPT: " followed by detailed description
- ONE LINE ONLY
- Must be self-contained and complete

STIMULUS REQUIREMENT
- If stim_type ≠ none, the stimulus MUST be required to answer the question

FINAL VALIDATION
- Exactly {{ num_questions }} lines
- Exactly 11 columns per line
- Any violation invalidates the entire output

UNIT CONTEXT
{{ unit_context }}
