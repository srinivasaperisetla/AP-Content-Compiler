Role: AP {{ course_name }} FRQ writer.

TASK
Create exactly {{ num_frqs }} AP-style Free Response Questions (FRQs) using the UNIT CONTEXT provided.

OUTPUT (STRICT TSV)
- EXACTLY {{ num_frqs }} lines
- NO header, NO blank lines, NO extra text
- Each line MUST have 8 TAB-separated columns in THIS EXACT ORDER:

diff	skill_codes	lo_ids	context	parts	scoring_guidelines	stim_type	stim_payload

COLUMN RULES

diff:
- easy | medium | hard

skill_codes:
- Comma-separated
- ALL codes MUST be from ALLOWED_SKILLS
- At least one required

lo_ids:
- Comma-separated
- ALL IDs MUST be from ALLOWED_LOS
- At least one required
- PRIORITIZE these under-covered LOs: {{ priority_los }}

context:
- The main FRQ scenario/prompt that sets up the question
- Must be clear, AP-appropriate, and realistic
- Should provide sufficient context for all parts
- No line breaks (use single line of text)

parts:
- Pipe-separated (|) list of question parts
- Each part MUST start with a lowercase letter label followed by period or parenthesis
- Format: "a. First part prompt|b. Second part prompt|c. Third part prompt"
- Use appropriate AP task verbs (describe, explain, calculate, justify, compare, interpret, etc.)
- Minimum 2 parts, typical 3-4 parts
- Parts should build on each other when appropriate

scoring_guidelines:
- Pipe-separated (|) list of scoring criteria
- Format: "Part a (1pt): Criteria for part a|Part b (2pts): Criteria for part b|Part c (1pt): Criteria for part c"
- Be specific and point-oriented
- Total points typically 4-6 per FRQ
- Clear expectations for earning points

stim_type:
- none | image
- If visual content is needed (chart, table, diagram, molecular structure, circuit, experimental setup, etc.), use "image"

====================
MATHEMATICAL NOTATION
====================

- ALL mathematical expressions MUST use LaTeX format
- Inline math: $expression$ (e.g., $\alpha$, $H_0: p = 0.75$, $\hat{p}$)
- Display math: $$expression$$ (for larger equations on separate line)
- Common symbols:
  * Greek: $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\mu$, $\sigma$, $\pi$
  * Operators: $\ge$, $\le$, $\ne$, $\pm$, $\times$, $\div$
  * Stats: $\bar{x}$, $\hat{p}$, $s^2$, $\sqrt{n}$, $\frac{a}{b}$
  * Subscripts/superscripts: $x_i$, $n^2$
- Examples:
  * GOOD: "Test $H_0: p = 0.75$ versus $H_a: p < 0.75$"
  * GOOD: "If $n\hat{p} \ge 10$ and $n(1-\hat{p}) \ge 10$, then..."
  * GOOD: "The test statistic is $\frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}}$"
  * BAD: "Test H_0: p = 0.75 versus H_a: p < 0.75"
  * BAD: "(x - mu) / (s / sqrt(n))"
- Apply LaTeX formatting in context, parts, and scoring_guidelines
- Tables should use LaTeX for any math in cells

====================
IMAGE PROMPT FORMAT (STRICT)
====================

If stim_type = image, provide a detailed prompt describing the image to generate in stim_payload.

FORMAT: IMAGE_PROMPT: [detailed description]

CRITICAL IMAGE RULES (AP EXAM STANDARDS):
✗ DO NOT describe images that include question text
✗ DO NOT describe images that include answer choices (A/B/C/D)
✗ DO NOT describe images with question-related titles/captions
✓ DO describe standalone visual stimuli: diagrams, charts, graphs, data tables, scenarios
✓ DO include only labels that identify parts of the diagram/data (e.g., axis labels, force vectors, chemical structures)
✓ The image should be something students look at TO ANSWER a question, not something that CONTAINS the question

Write prompts like a creative director: be highly detailed and visually striking.
Be specific about: layout, labels, values, colors, style, atmosphere, composition, specific visual elements.
Include descriptive language about the scene, atmosphere, and desired aesthetic.

GOOD IMAGE PROMPT EXAMPLES:
• "IMAGE_PROMPT: Create a highly detailed scatterplot showing the relationship between study hours (x-axis, 0-10 hours) and test scores (y-axis, 0-100). Plot 15 points showing a positive linear trend with some scatter. Include clear axis labels and gridlines. Use professional academic styling with good contrast and readability. NO title, NO question text, NO explanatory captions - just the pure data visualization."

• "IMAGE_PROMPT: Create a professional data table with clear formatting suitable for academic presentation. Table has 4 columns with headers: Treatment Group, Sample Size, Mean Response, Standard Deviation. Include 3 data rows: Control with n=30, mean=72.5, SD=8.2; Treatment A with n=28, mean=78.3, SD=7.9; Treatment B with n=32, mean=81.7, SD=6.5. Use clean lines, professional fonts, and ensure all text is clearly readable. This is raw data for students to analyze - NO titles, NO question references, NO interpretive text."

• "IMAGE_PROMPT: Create a detailed experimental setup diagram showing a randomized block design. Display 3 blocks (Block 1, Block 2, Block 3) with 4 treatment groups (A, B, C, D) in each block. Use boxes to represent experimental units, with clear labels for each treatment within each block. Include arrows showing random assignment within blocks. The diagram should be clean, educational, suitable for an AP exam. NO question text, NO explanatory paragraph."

• "IMAGE_PROMPT: Create a clear boxplot comparison showing distributions for three groups side-by-side. Label x-axis with Group 1, Group 2, Group 3. Y-axis ranges from 0 to 100 labeled 'Test Score'. Show five-number summaries with boxes, whiskers, and median lines clearly visible. Group 1: min=45, Q1=60, median=70, Q3=80, max=95. Group 2: min=50, Q1=65, median=75, Q3=85, max=98. Group 3: min=40, Q1=58, median=68, Q3=78, max=92. Use professional colors and clear labels. NO title, NO question text."

IMPORTANT:
- For tables in images, describe all data clearly in natural language with exact values
- For mathematical content in images, write out formulas and symbols in natural language (e.g., "mu equals 50" or "p-hat" rather than using LaTeX)
- For complex diagrams (molecular, circuit, free body), be extremely detailed about every element
- Be comprehensive - the image generator needs all details to create accurate educational content

====================
stim_payload rules
====================

- If stim_type = none → MUST be empty
- If stim_type = image → must start with "IMAGE_PROMPT: " followed by detailed description
- ONE LINE ONLY
- Must be self-contained and complete

STIMULUS REQUIREMENT
- Include stimulus ONLY if necessary for answering the question
- If included, the question MUST depend on the stimulus for correctness

FRQ DESIGN PRINCIPLES
- Each FRQ should assess multiple learning objectives when possible
- Use realistic scenarios appropriate to AP Statistics
- Parts should increase in cognitive complexity (calculate → explain → justify)
- Avoid overly contrived scenarios
- Balance computational and conceptual questions
- Ensure diversity across FRQs (different topics, contexts, skills)

TASK VERB GUIDANCE (use appropriately across parts)
- Describe: Provide characteristics and features
- Explain: Provide reasoning or justification
- Calculate: Perform computation and show work
- Justify: Provide evidence or reasoning
- Compare: Describe similarities and differences
- Interpret: Translate meaning in context
- Identify: Indicate or provide information
- Construct: Create (graph, model, etc.)

FINAL VALIDATION
- Exactly {{ num_frqs }} lines
- Exactly 8 columns per line
- All skill_codes from ALLOWED_SKILLS
- All lo_ids from ALLOWED_LOS
- Parts properly formatted with labels (a., b., c., etc.)
- Any violation invalidates the entire output
