    <div class="question-text">
      A pharmaceutical company is testing a new drug to reduce allergy symptoms. A randomized experiment was conducted with 300 volunteers who suffer from allergies. The volunteers were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Group A (New Drug), Group B (Competitor's Drug), and Group C (Placebo). After one week, each volunteer rated their allergy symptom relief as "significant," "moderate," or "none." Researchers want to test if the distribution of symptom relief is the same for the three treatment groups. What are the appropriate null hypothesis and degrees of freedom for the chi-square test?
    </div>

    <ul class="choices">
      
        <li>A. H₀: There is no association between treatment group and symptom relief. The degrees of freedom are 2.</li>
      
        <li>B. H₀: The distribution of symptom relief is the same for the three treatment groups. The degrees of freedom are 4.</li>
      
        <li>C. H₀: The proportion of volunteers experiencing significant relief is the same for all three groups. The degrees of freedom are 2.</li>
      
        <li>D. H₀: The distribution of symptom relief is the same for the three treatment groups. The degrees of freedom are 8.</li>
