        <li>A. The model from Plot A is more appropriate for inference because the residuals follow a clear pattern.</li>
      
        <li>B. The model from Plot B is more appropriate for inference because the residuals are randomly scattered, satisfying the linearity condition.</li>
      
        <li>C. Neither model is appropriate for inference because both plots show non-constant variance of the residuals.</li>
      
        <li>D. The model from Plot B is less appropriate for inference because transforming the data always introduces bias.</li>
