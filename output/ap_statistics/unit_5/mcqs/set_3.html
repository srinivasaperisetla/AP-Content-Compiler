      The time it takes for a certain brand of battery to fail is non-normally distributed with a mean of 400 hours and a standard deviation of 50 hours. A quality control specialist selects a random sample of 25 batteries to test. The specialist wants to calculate the probability that the mean lifetime of the sample of batteries is less than 390 hours. Which of the following is the primary reason why the specialist cannot use the standard normal distribution to calculate this probability?
