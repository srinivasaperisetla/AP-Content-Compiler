      A national survey in the previous year found that 38% of adults owned a pet. A sociologist believes that the proportion of adults who own a pet has increased this year. They take a random sample of 500 adults and find that 205 own a pet. They conduct a one-proportion z-test, resulting in a p-value of 0.057.

        <li>C. ecause the p-value of 0.057 is greater than α = 0.05, the sociologist should fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not convincing evidence that the proportion of adults who own a pet has increased.</li>
      
        <li>D. ecause the p-value of 0.057 is close to α = 0.05, the sociologist should conclude that the result is statistically significant and the proportion of adults who own a pet has increased.</li>

      A city official claims that the proportion of residents who favor a new recycling program is greater than 0.70. To test this claim, a random sample of 200 residents is surveyed, and 150 of them support the program. The test statistic for a one-sample z-test for a proportion is calculated to be z ≈ 1.54, and the corresponding p-value is 0.062. Assuming the conditions for inference have been met, which of the following is the most appropriate conclusion at a significance level of α = 0.05?
    </div>

    <ul class="choices">
      
        <li>A. Since the p-value is greater than α, we reject the null hypothesis. There is convincing evidence that the proportion of residents who favor the program is greater than 0.70.</li>
      
        <li>B. Since the p-value is greater than α, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not convincing evidence that the proportion of residents who favor the program is greater than 0.70.</li>
      
        <li>C. Since the p-value is less than α, we reject the null hypothesis. There is convincing evidence that the proportion of residents who favor the program is greater than 0.70.</li>
