|--------------|-------|----------------|-------|-------|
| Undergraduate| 80    | 50             | 20    | 150   |
| Graduate     | 30    | 15             | 5     | 50    |
| Total        | 110   | 65             | 25    | 200   |

Assuming the conditions for inference are met, what is the expected count of graduate students who use public transit?
