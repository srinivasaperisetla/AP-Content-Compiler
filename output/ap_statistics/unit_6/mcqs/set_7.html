      A sociologist surveyed a random sample of 300 adults in a suburban town to investigate a possible association between education level and opinion on a proposed new library. A chi-square test for independence was conducted, resulting in a test statistic of χ² = 9.85 and a p-value of 0.043.

        <li>A. Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. There is convincing evidence of an association between education level and opinion on the new library for adults in this town.</li>
      
        <li>B. Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not convincing evidence of an association between education level and opinion on the new library for adults in this town.</li>
