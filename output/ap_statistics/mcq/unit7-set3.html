        <ul class="choices">
          
          <li>A. Since 10,000 hours is included in the confidence interval, there is no statistically significant evidence at the 1% level to reject the company's claim.</li>
          
          <li>B. Since the interval extends below 10,000 hours, there is evidence that the average lifespan is less than claimed.</li>
          
          <li>C. Since the interval is relatively narrow, it strongly confirms that the true mean is exactly 10,000 hours.</li>
          
          <li>D. Since the interval covers a range of values, the claim of exactly 10,000 hours cannot be definitively confirmed or rejected.</li>
