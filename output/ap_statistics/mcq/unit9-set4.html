A 90% confidence interval for the true slope relating fertilizer amount (in kg/hectare) to crop yield (in tons/hectare) is calculated as $(0.8, 1.5)$. Based on this interval, which of the following conclusions is most appropriate?</div>

        <ul class="choices">
          
          <li>A. Since the entire interval is positive and does not include 0, there is convincing evidence that increasing fertilizer amount is associated with an increase in crop yield.</li>
          
          <li>B. Since the interval includes values greater than 1, we can conclude that for every 1 kg/hectare increase in fertilizer, crop yield increases by at least 1 ton/hectare.</li>
          
          <li>C. We cannot conclude that increasing fertilizer amount causes an increase in crop yield, as the interval does not cover the full range of possible yields.</li>
