    <div class="question-text">
      A researcher investigated the relationship between the age of a driver (in years) and the distance (in feet) at which they could read a highway sign. The least-squares regression line is ŷ = 580 - 3x, where y is the distance and x is the age. The coefficient of determination is r² = 0.64. Which of the following is the best interpretation of this r-squared value?
    </div>

    <ul class="choices">
      
        <li>A. For every one-year increase in age, the reading distance is predicted to decrease by about 0.64 feet.</li>
      
        <li>B. bout 64% of the variability in reading distance is accounted for by the linear model relating reading distance to age.</li>
      
        <li>C. bout 64% of the data points fall on the least-squares regression line.</li>
      
        <li>D. The correlation between age and reading distance is 0.64, indicating a moderately strong positive relationship.</li>
      
    </ul>
