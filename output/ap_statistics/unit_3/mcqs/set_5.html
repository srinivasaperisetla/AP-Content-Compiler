      To test the effectiveness of a new teaching method for algebra, a researcher recruited 80 student volunteers from a large district. The researcher randomly assigned 40 volunteers to be taught with the new method and 40 volunteers to be taught with the traditional method.

Based on this study, which of the following is an appropriate conclusion?

      Researchers are conducting an experiment to determine if a new brand of fertilizer increases the yield of tomato plants. They have 50 tomato plants in a greenhouse.
