      An agricultural scientist was interested in the effect of a new fertilizer on the yield of tomato plants. The scientist randomly selected 30 plots of land from a large region known for tomato farming. Within each plot, half of the tomato plants were randomly assigned to be treated with the new fertilizer, and the other half were treated with a standard fertilizer. At the end of the growing season, the yield of tomatoes from the plants receiving the new fertilizer was, on average, significantly higher than the yield from the plants receiving the standard fertilizer. Which of the following is the most appropriate conclusion?

        <li>A. The new fertilizer causes a higher yield, and this result can be generalized to all tomato plants in the large region.</li>

      An experiment is designed to compare the effects of three different fertilizers (A, B, and C) and a control (no fertilizer) on the yield of tomato plants. 40 identical tomato seedlings are available for the experiment.

The experimenters randomly assign 10 seedlings to each of the four treatment groups. What is the primary weakness of this experimental design?
