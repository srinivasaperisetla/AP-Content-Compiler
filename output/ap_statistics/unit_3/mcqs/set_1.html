      A researcher wants to determine if a new brand of fertilizer increases the yield of strawberry plants. The researcher has 60 strawberry plants available. The plants are randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group receives the new fertilizer, and the other group receives a standard fertilizer. The yield, in pounds, of each plant is measured at the end of the growing season. In this experiment, what is the response variable?

      A study was conducted to determine if listening to classical music while studying improves test scores for high school students. A group of 100 high school student volunteers were randomly assigned to two groups. One group studied in a quiet room, and the other group studied while listening to classical music. Both groups were then given the same test. The group that listened to music had a significantly higher average score. What conclusions can be drawn from this study?

      An agricultural scientist wants to compare the effectiveness of three types of pesticides on a certain crop. The scientist has access to four different fields, each with slightly different soil composition. The scientist is concerned that the soil differences might affect the pesticide performance. To account for this, the scientist divides each of the four fields into three plots and randomly assigns one of the three pesticides to each plot within each field. What is the primary reason for using the fields as blocks in this experiment?

      A medical researcher conducted an experiment to investigate whether a new drug reduces blood pressure. The researcher recruited 200 adult volunteers with high blood pressure. They randomly assigned 100 volunteers to receive the new drug and 100 volunteers to receive a placebo.

Which of the following is a valid conclusion from this study?
