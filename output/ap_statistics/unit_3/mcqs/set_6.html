      To get a representative sample of students at a large university, a researcher divides the student population by major (e.g., Engineering, Arts & Sciences, Business, etc.). The researcher then takes a simple random sample of students from each major, ensuring the proportion of students from each major in the sample is the same as the proportion in the overall student population. What sampling method is being used?
