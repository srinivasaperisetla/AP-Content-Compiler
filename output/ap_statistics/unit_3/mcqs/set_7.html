      A polling organization wants to estimate the proportion of adults in a large city who support a new public transportation initiative. They conduct a survey by calling landline telephone numbers between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on weekdays. Which of the following is the most likely potential source of bias in this survey?
    </div>

    <ul class="choices">
      
        <li>A. Response bias, because respondents may not give truthful answers to a person over the phone.</li>
      
        <li>B. Wording bias, because the question may be phrased in a way that influences the answer.</li>
      
        <li>C. Undercoverage bias, because the sampling frame excludes adults without landlines or who are not home during the day.</li>
      
        <li>D. Voluntary response bias, because only those who choose to answer the phone will be included.</li>

      An agricultural scientist wants to test the effect of a new fertilizer on the yield of corn. They have 60 plots of land available for the experiment. Twenty plots are randomly assigned to receive the new fertilizer, 20 plots receive a standard fertilizer, and 20 plots receive no fertilizer (control). The yield of corn (in bushels per acre) is measured for each plot. What are the treatments in this experiment?

      To investigate the relationship between drinking coffee and sleeping habits, a researcher asks 200 adults to report the average number of cups of coffee they drink per day and the average number of hours they sleep per night. The researcher finds that adults who drink more coffee tend to sleep fewer hours. Which of the following is a correct statement about this study?

    <ul class="choices">
      
        <li>A. This is an experiment, and it can be concluded that drinking more coffee causes a reduction in sleep.</li>

        <li>C. This is an experiment, but cause and effect cannot be concluded due to potential confounding variables.</li>

      A researcher is designing an experiment to compare the durability of two new types of golf balls (Type X and Type Y). They suspect that the durability might be affected by the swing speed of the golfer. To account for this, they recruit 40 golfers and categorize them into two groups: 20 with high swing speeds and 20 with low swing speeds. Within each group, 10 golfers are randomly assigned to use Type X balls and 10 are assigned to use Type Y balls. What is the primary reason for categorizing golfers by swing speed?
    </div>

    <ul class="choices">
      
        <li>A. To allow for the use of a placebo, ensuring that golfers do not know which type of ball they are using.</li>
      
        <li>B. To reduce a known source of variability in the response variable (durability), making it easier to detect a difference between the two ball types.</li>
      
        <li>C. To ensure that the sample of 40 golfers is a simple random sample of all golfers.</li>
      
        <li>D. To eliminate the need for random assignment of ball types to golfers.</li>
