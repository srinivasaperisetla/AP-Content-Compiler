      A medical researcher is testing the effectiveness of a new allergy medication. They recruit 100 volunteers who suffer from allergies. The researcher suspects that the medication's effectiveness might differ between people who live in urban environments and those who live in rural environments. To account for this, the researcher separates the volunteers based on their living environment and then, within each group, randomly assigns half of the volunteers to receive the new medication and half to receive a placebo. What is the primary reason for designing the experiment this way?
