      <div class="prompt">A research team investigated the relationship between the amount of time high school students spend on extracurricular activities and their academic performance (measured by GPA). They surveyed 500 randomly selected high school students, collecting data on their weekly extracurricular hours and their current GPA.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Identify the type of study described. Justify your answer.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Based on this study design, can the research team conclude that spending more time on extracurricular activities causes an improvement in academic performance? Explain why or why not.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Describe a potential confounding variable in this study and explain how it could affect the observed relationship between extracurricular activities and academic performance.

          <li>Part c (2pts): Identifies a plausible confounding variable (e.g., family income, motivation, prior academic ability) and explains its relationship to both extracurriculars and GPA, showing how it could create a spurious association.</li>

      <h2>FRQ 2</h2>

        The newspaper sends reporters to a popular shopping mall on a Saturday afternoon and asks the first 200 willing residents they encounter to complete the survey. Identify the sampling method used.

      <div class="prompt">A company produces a new fertilizer and wants to test its effectiveness on tomato plant growth. They have 60 similar tomato plants available for an experiment.

      <h2>FRQ 4</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A pharmaceutical company is developing a new nasal spray to alleviate allergy symptoms. They want to compare the new spray (Drug X) to a placebo. They recruit 300 volunteers who suffer from seasonal allergies.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Describe how the company should incorporate both a placebo and blinding (single-blind and double-blind) into the design of this experiment. Explain the purpose of each.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        After conducting the experiment, the company analyzes the data and finds that participants who used Drug X reported significantly fewer allergy symptoms than those who used the placebo. Interpret what "significantly fewer" means in this context.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>

        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (3pts): Describes the use of a placebo and explains its purpose (control for psychological effect); describes single-blinding (participants unaware) and double-blinding (both participants and researchers/evaluators unaware) and explains their purposes (reduce bias).</li>

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Identifies two clear statistical questions related to public opinion on the community center (e.g., "What proportion of residents support the new center?", "What is the average amount residents are willing to pay for membership?").</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Identifies voluntary response bias or selection bias/undercoverage (only residents with internet access who visit the site) and explains how it would lead to an over- or underestimation of support, or a non-representative sample.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Suggests a reasonable modification (e.g., random phone survey, stratified random survey of households) and explains how it would address the identified bias by providing a more representative sample.</li>
