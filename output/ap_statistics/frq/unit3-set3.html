      <div class="prompt">A high school principal wants to determine student opinion about a proposed change to the school's lunch schedule. There are 1,000 students enrolled in the school. The principal decides to survey 100 students.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Describe how the principal could use a simple random sample to select the 100 students.

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        The principal considers surveying the first 100 students who arrive at school on a specific Monday morning. Identify a potential source of bias for this sampling method and explain how it might affect the results.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Another proposal is to select 20 students randomly from each of the five grade levels (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and unclassified). Identify this sampling method and explain why it might be preferred over a simple random sample in this context.

      <div class="prompt">Researchers are investigating the relationship between daily exercise and cholesterol levels in adults. They recruit 500 volunteers aged 30-50 and collect data on their average daily exercise duration and their cholesterol levels over a six-month period.

        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Based on this study, can the researchers conclude that increased daily exercise causes a reduction in cholesterol levels? Justify your answer.

      <div class="part">

      <div class="prompt">A pharmaceutical company is developing a new drug to lower blood pressure. They want to test its effectiveness compared to an existing drug and a placebo. They recruit 300 adult patients with high blood pressure who volunteer for the study.</div>

      <h2>FRQ 4</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A large university wants to conduct a survey to estimate the average amount of money students spend on textbooks per semester. The university has 40,000 students, divided into four colleges: Arts and Sciences (20,000 students), Engineering (10,000 students), Business (7,000 students), and Education (3,000 students).

      <h2>FRQ 5</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A horticulturist is testing two new types of soil, Soil A and Soil B, to see which promotes faster growth in a specific species of flower. They have 100 seedlings of uniform size. They want to set up an experiment to compare the average growth height after 8 weeks.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Describe a completely randomized design for this experiment. Explain why random assignment is important in this context.

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Suppose the horticulturist found that after 8 weeks, flowers grown in Soil A had an average height of 25 cm, while those in Soil B had an average height of 22 cm. A statistical analysis revealed a p-value of $0.008$. Interpret this p-value in the context of this experiment and state what conclusion the horticulturist could draw at the $\alpha = 0.05$ significance level.

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Describes randomly assigning 50 seedlings to Soil A and 50 to Soil B. Explains that random assignment helps create comparable groups, reducing confounding variables and allowing for causal conclusions.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Interprets the p-value: There is a 0.008 probability of observing a difference in average heights as extreme as 3 cm (or more) if there were no actual difference between the soils. Concludes that there is statistically significant evidence to suggest that Soil A promotes faster growth than Soil B at $\alpha = 0.05$.</li>
