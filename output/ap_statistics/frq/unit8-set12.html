Interprets p-value in context (probability of observed deviation or more extreme if null is true). (df = $3-1 = 2$. $P(X^2 > 5.2) \approx 0.074$.

There is statistically significant evidence to conclude that there is an association between the primary activity visitors engage in and their preferred accommodation type in the national park.

      <div class="prompt">A study investigated whether the distribution of blood types (O, A, B, AB) in a certain region matches the national distribution (O: 45%, A: 40%, B: 10%, AB: 5%). A random sample of 300 individuals from the region was taken. The observed counts were O: 145, A: 120, B: 25, AB: 10.

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): Describes the chi-square distribution as skewed right and explains that as df increases, the distribution becomes more symmetric/less skewed, and its center shifts to the right. (The chi-square distribution is skewed to the right. As the degrees of freedom increase, the chi-square distribution becomes less skewed and more symmetric, and its peak shifts further to the right.)</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): Interprets the p-value in the context of the study. (If the true distribution of blood types in the region is the same as the national distribution, there is a 29.89% chance of observing a sample distribution as different from the national distribution, or more different, than the one observed in this study, purely by random chance.)</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Compares p-value to $\alpha$ and states correct conclusion in context with justification. (Since the p-value ($0.2989$) is greater than $\alpha$ ($0.10$), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the distribution of blood types in this region differs from the national distribution.)</li>
          
          <li>Part d (2pts): Explains the effect on the chi-square statistic and p-value by considering the difference between observed and expected counts. (If the observed count for O was 155, the difference from the expected count (which would be $0.45 \times 300 = 135$) would be larger ($</li>
          
          <li>155-135</li>
          
          <li>=20$) compared to the original ($</li>
          
          <li>145-135</li>
          
          <li>=10$). A larger difference between observed and expected counts generally leads to a larger contribution to the chi-square statistic, thus increasing the overall chi-square test statistic. A larger chi-square statistic would lead to a smaller p-value.)</li>
