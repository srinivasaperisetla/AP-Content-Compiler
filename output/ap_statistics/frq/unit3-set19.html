      <h2>FRQ 2</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A large high school with 2,000 students wants to survey its students to gauge their satisfaction with the school's new academic advising program. The school wants to ensure that students from all four grade levels (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior) are represented proportionally in the sample.</div>

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Describe how to select a stratified random sample of 200 students, ensuring proportional representation from each grade level. Explain why this method might be preferred over a simple random sample in this context.

          <li>Part b (3pts): Describes how to divide the population into strata (grade levels), calculates the proportional number of students to sample from each stratum, and describes how to select an SRS from each stratum.

      <h2>FRQ 3</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A pharmaceutical company is developing a new nasal spray designed to reduce allergy symptoms. They want to test its effectiveness compared to a placebo. One hundred volunteers who suffer from seasonal allergies are recruited for the study.</div>

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1.5pt): Identifies experimental units as the 100 volunteers, explanatory variable as the type of nasal spray (new drug vs. placebo), and response variable as the severity of allergy symptoms (0.5 pt for each correct identification).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Describes blinding (e.g., neither patient nor doctor knows who received which treatment) and explains its purpose (to reduce bias from participant expectations or researcher observation).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1.5pt): Proposes a method for random assignment (e.g., assign numbers 1-100, use a random number generator to select 50 for the new spray group, the remaining 50 go to the placebo group) and indicates it helps balance groups by distributing potential confounding variables evenly.</li>

      <h2>FRQ 4</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A college psychology department wants to compare two different instructional methods (Method A and Method B) for a new statistics course. They have 120 students enrolled in the course. The department is concerned that students' prior math aptitude might influence the effectiveness of the instructional methods.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Describe how to design a completely randomized experiment to compare the two instructional methods. Include details on assignment and measurement.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Describe how to design a randomized block experiment to compare the two instructional methods, taking into account students' prior math aptitude. Specify how blocking would be implemented.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Explain why the randomized block design might be preferred over the completely randomized design in this context.

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Describes assigning all 120 students randomly to one of two groups (60 to Method A, 60 to Method B) and measuring a common outcome (e.g., final exam score).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2.5pts): Describes dividing students into blocks based on prior math aptitude (e.g., high, medium, low aptitude students). Within each block, students are randomly assigned to either Method A or Method B, maintaining equal group sizes per method within each block. Measurement is the same as in part (a).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1.5pt): Explains that the randomized block design controls for the variability due to math aptitude, which is a known source of variation, thus reducing the variability within treatment groups and making it easier to detect a difference between the instructional methods if one truly exists.</li>

      <div class="prompt">A group of researchers wants to investigate the relationship between the number of hours high school students spend on social media per week and their average GPA.

        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Based on this study design, can the researchers establish that spending more hours on social media causes a lower GPA? Explain why or why not.

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Identify one potential source of bias in this study. Explain how this bias might affect the conclusions drawn.

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): Observational study (0.5pt) because researchers observed characteristics and measured variables without imposing treatments (0.5pt).</li>
