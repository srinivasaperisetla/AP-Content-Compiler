        Suppose another brand of battery has a mean lifespan of 60 hours and a standard deviation of 5 hours. If a battery from the first brand lasts 58 hours and a battery from the second brand lasts 62 hours, which battery has a relatively longer lifespan compared to its own brand's batteries?

          <li>Part b (2pts): Finds the $z$-score corresponding to the 85th percentile (approx. 1.04) and calculates the minimum lifespan ($55 + 1.04 \times 4 = 59.16$ hours). (1pt for correct $z$-score, 1pt for correct lifespan)</li>

Compares $z$-scores and concludes that the first battery has a relatively longer lifespan because its $z$-score is higher.
