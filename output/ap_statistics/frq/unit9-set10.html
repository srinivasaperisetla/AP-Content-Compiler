          <li>Part a (1pt): $H_0: \beta = 0$, $H_a: \beta > 0$ (or equivalent in context).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Checks Linearity, Independence (random sample, $10\%$ condition if applicable), Normality (of residuals), Equal Variance, Random condition.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Test statistic $t = \frac{b - \beta_0}{SE_b} = \frac{0.6 - 0}{0.25} = 2.4$. Degrees of freedom $df = n-2 = 23$. P-value for $t=2.4$ with $df=23$ is between $0.01$ and $0.025$ (or calculator value of approx $0.012$).</li>
          
          <li>Part d (1pt): Compares p-value to $\alpha$. Rejects $H_0$ because $0.012 < 0.05$. Concludes there is sufficient evidence of a positive linear relationship between DBH and tree height.</li>
