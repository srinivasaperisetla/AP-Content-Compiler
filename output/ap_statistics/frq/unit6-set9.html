        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Identifies a one-sample z-interval for a proportion (1pt). Verifies conditions: Random sample (given), $n\hat{p} = 500(0.36) = 180 \ge 10$, $n(1-\hat{p}) = 500(0.64) = 320 \ge 10$ (1pt).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Calculates the sample proportion $\hat{p} = 180/500 = 0.36$ and standard error $\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.36(0.64)}{500}} \approx 0.02149$ (1pt). Calculates the confidence interval using $0.36 \pm 1.96(0.02149)$, resulting in $(0.3179, 0.4021)$ (1pt).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Correctly interprets the confidence interval: "We are 95% confident that the true proportion of adults in this region who regularly consume a diet rich in fruits and vegetables is between 0.3179 and 0.4021." (1pt).</li>
          
          <li>Part d (1pt): States that the claim is plausible because 0.40 (or 40%) is contained within or very close to the interval, implying values less than 40% are consistent with the interval (1pt).</li>
          
          <li>Part e (2pts): Sets up the margin of error formula: $0.02 = z^* \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$. Uses $z^*=1.96$ and $\hat{p}=0.36$: $0.02 = 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{0.36(0.64)}{n}}$ (1pt). Solves for $n$: $n = \frac{1.96^2 \times 0.36 \times 0.64}{0.02^2} \approx 2212.67$. Rounds up to $n = 2213$ (1pt).</li>

          <li>Part c (2pts): Calculates $\hat{p} = 24/150 = 0.16$ (0.5pt). Calculates the test statistic $z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}} = \frac{0.16 - 0.20}{\sqrt{\frac{0.20(0.80)}{150}}} \approx -1.225$ (1pt).

          <li>Part d (2pts): Compares p-value to $\alpha$: $0.1103 > 0.05$ (1pt). Concludes fail to reject $H_0$ and states there is not convincing evidence that the true proportion of green candies is less than 20% (1pt).</li>

      <div class="prompt">A pharmaceutical company is testing a new drug designed to reduce the proportion of patients who experience a certain side effect. Historically, 30% of patients experience this side effect with the old drug. The company wants to determine if the new drug reduces this proportion.

        <ul>

          <li>Part b (1pt): The consequence of a Type I error is that the company would market an ineffective drug as being better, potentially leading to financial losses or patient dissatisfaction, when the new drug is not actually better than the old one in reducing the side effect. (1pt).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): To decrease the probability of a Type II error, the company could increase the sample size, increase the significance level $\alpha$, or use a drug that has a larger true reduction in the side effect (larger difference between the true $p$ and $p_0$) (1pt for any one of these).</li>
