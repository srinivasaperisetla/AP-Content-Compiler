      <div class="prompt">A group of researchers wanted to investigate the relationship between daily coffee consumption and the incidence of heart disease in adults aged 40-60. They collected data from 1,000 adults in this age group, noting their self-reported average daily coffee intake and whether they had been diagnosed with heart disease.</div>

      <h2>FRQ 2</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A high school principal wants to gauge student opinions on a proposed change to the school's bell schedule. The school has 1,200 students across four grades (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th), with approximately 300 students in each grade.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        The principal decides to select the first 100 students who arrive at school on a Monday morning and surveys them. Identify the sampling method used and explain why this method might lead to a biased estimate of student opinion.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Describe a method for selecting a simple random sample of 100 students from the entire school population. You do not need to perform the sampling.

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Explain why a stratified random sample might be preferable to a simple random sample in this context.

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Identifies the method as a convenience sample AND explains that students arriving early might have different opinions (e.g., more punctual, involved in extracurriculars) than those who arrive later or are absent, leading to an over- or under-representation of certain opinions.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): Describes a correct procedure for a simple random sample (e.g., assign each student a unique number 1-1200, use a random number generator to select 100 unique numbers, then survey the corresponding students).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Explains that a stratified random sample would ensure representation from each grade level, which might have different opinions on the bell schedule, thereby reducing variability and providing more precise estimates of overall student opinion or allowing for comparisons between grades.</li>

      <div class="prompt">Agricultural researchers are developing a new type of fertilizer (Fertilizer B) and want to compare its effectiveness to their standard fertilizer (Fertilizer A) on tomato plant yield.

        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Explain the purpose of randomization in this experiment.

      <div class="guidelines">
        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Correctly identifies experimental units as the 60 tomato plants, treatments as Fertilizer A and Fertilizer B, and response variable as tomato plant yield (e.g., total weight of tomatoes per plant, number of tomatoes per plant).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): Describes a method for blinding, such as ensuring the people applying the fertilizer or measuring the yield do not know which fertilizer (A or B) was applied to which plant, or not letting the people in the field know which plant got which fertilizer.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Explains that randomization helps create roughly equivalent groups with respect to other variables (e.g., subtle differences in soil quality, sunlight exposure, inherent plant vigor) that could affect yield, thus reducing the chance that any observed differences are due to these lurking variables rather than the fertilizers.</li>

      <div class="prompt">A fitness company wants to compare the effectiveness of two new exercise programs, Program X and Program Y, on reducing body fat percentage. They have 100 volunteers for the study.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        The company is concerned that volunteers' initial fitness levels (low, medium, high) might influence the effectiveness of the programs. Propose an alternative experimental design that addresses this concern, and describe how you would assign treatments using this design.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>

      <div class="guidelines">
        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Describes correctly assigning all 100 volunteers to one of two groups (e.g., using a random number generator to assign 50 to Program X and 50 to Program Y) AND clarifies that each volunteer receives only one program.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Proposes a block design, specifically blocking by initial fitness level (low, medium, high), AND describes how to randomly assign an equal number of participants within each block to Program X or Program Y.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Explains that blocking by initial fitness level helps reduce variability within treatment groups and makes it easier to detect a difference between Program X and Program Y if one truly exists, by accounting for a known source of variation (initial fitness level).</li>

      <h2>FRQ 5</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A randomized controlled experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of a new herbal supplement on blood pressure. 200 participants with high blood pressure were randomly assigned to two groups: one received the herbal supplement daily for 8 weeks (treatment group), and the other received a placebo (control group). Neither the participants nor the researchers knew who received which treatment. At the end of 8 weeks, the change in systolic blood pressure (in mmHg) was recorded for each participant.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Based on the study design, can the researchers establish a cause-and-effect relationship between the herbal supplement and a change in blood pressure? Justify your answer.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        The researchers found that the average decrease in systolic blood pressure in the treatment group was $8.5$ mmHg, while the average decrease in the placebo group was $2.1$ mmHg. A statistical test indicated that this difference was statistically significant ($p < 0.01$). Interpret what it means for the difference to be "statistically significant" in the context of this study.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        What specific conclusions can be drawn from this experiment regarding the herbal supplement and blood pressure?

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): States "Yes" AND justifies that because it was a randomized controlled experiment with a placebo and blinding, confounding variables are minimized, allowing for cause-and-effect conclusions.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Explains that a statistically significant result means that a difference as large as or larger than the observed $8.5 - 2.1 = 6.4$ mmHg in average decrease would be unlikely to occur by random chance if the herbal supplement had no true effect on blood pressure.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Concludes that the herbal supplement causes a decrease in systolic blood pressure for individuals with high blood pressure, and this finding can be generalized to the population of adults with high blood pressure similar to those in the study.</li>
