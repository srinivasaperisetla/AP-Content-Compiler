          <li>Part a (2pts): A Type I error occurs if the true proportion of defective chips is $2\%$ or less ($H_0$ is true), but the consumer group concludes that it is greater than $2\%$ (rejects $H_0$) (1 pt); Consequence: The company is falsely accused of having a higher defect rate, potentially harming its reputation or leading to unnecessary production adjustments (1 pt)</li>

          <li>Part c (2pts): Increasing the sample size would decrease the probability of a Type II error (1 pt); Justification: A larger sample size provides more information, leading to a more precise estimate of the true proportion. This reduces the variability of the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$, making it easier to detect a true difference from the null hypothesis, thus increasing the power of the test and decreasing the probability of a Type II error (1 pt).</li>
