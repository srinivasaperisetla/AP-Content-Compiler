      <div class="prompt">The lifespan of a certain brand of light bulb is approximately normally distributed with a mean of $\mu = 800$ hours and a standard deviation of $\sigma = 50$ hours.</div>

       
      <div class="part">

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        The manufacturer wants to offer a warranty such that only 1% of light bulbs would need to be replaced. Determine the minimum lifespan (in hours) a light bulb must have to qualify for this warranty. Round your answer to the nearest hour.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Suppose another brand of light bulbs has a mean lifespan of 820 hours and a standard deviation of 60 hours. A light bulb from the first brand lasts 870 hours, and a light bulb from the second brand lasts 900 hours. Compare the relative positions of these two light bulbs within their respective distributions.

          <li>Part b (2pts): Finds the z-score corresponding to the 1st percentile (approx. $z = -2.33$) and uses it to calculate the minimum lifespan in hours ($X = \mu + z\sigma = 800 + (-2.33)(50) \approx 683.5$ hours, rounded to 684 hours). Shows all steps.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Calculates the z-score for each light bulb ($z_{Brand1} = \frac{870-800}{50} = 1.4$, $z_{Brand2} = \frac{900-820}{60} \approx 1.33$). Compares and interprets the z-scores to explain which light bulb has a relatively longer lifespan compared to its brand's average.</li>
