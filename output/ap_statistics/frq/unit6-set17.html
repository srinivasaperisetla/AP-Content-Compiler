      <h2>FRQ 3</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A pharmaceutical company is testing a new drug designed to reduce blood pressure. They want to determine if the drug is effective (i.e., if the proportion of patients whose blood pressure is reduced by the drug is significantly greater than 0.50). They conduct a clinical trial and set up their hypotheses as $H_0: p = 0.50$ versus $H_a: p > 0.50$, where $p$ is the true proportion of patients whose blood pressure is reduced.</div>

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1.5pts): A Type I error occurs if the company concludes the drug is effective (rejects $H_0$) when, in reality, it is not effective (the true proportion is 0.50). A potential consequence is that an ineffective drug could be approved and prescribed, costing money and potentially delaying effective treatment for patients.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1.5pts): A Type II error occurs if the company concludes the drug is not effective (fails to reject $H_0$) when, in reality, it is effective (the true proportion is greater than 0.50). A potential consequence is that a truly effective drug might not be approved, preventing patients from benefiting from a useful treatment.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Increasing the sample size would decrease the probability of a Type II error. A larger sample size provides more information, leading to a more precise estimate of the proportion, thus increasing the power of the test and making it more likely to detect a true effect if one exists.</li>
