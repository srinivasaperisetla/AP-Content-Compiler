      <div class="prompt">A company manufactures light bulbs, and 15% are defective. A quality control manager wants to estimate the probability that in a random sample of 10 bulbs, exactly 2 are defective.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Describe how you would set up and perform a simulation using a table of random digits to estimate the probability that exactly 2 out of 10 bulbs are defective. Clearly indicate what each digit represents and how you would count the number of defective bulbs.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Using the binomial probability formula, calculate the theoretical probability that exactly 2 out of 10 randomly selected bulbs are defective, assuming the company's claim is true.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        If a simulation yielded an estimated probability of $0.20$, explain how this compares to your calculated theoretical probability from part (b).

      <div class="prompt">A small coffee shop records the time (in minutes) a customer spends ordering at the counter, $C$, and the time a customer spends waiting for their drink to be prepared, $W$. Both $C$ and $W$ are independent random variables. The mean and standard deviation for each are: $E(C) = 2.5$ minutes, $\sigma_C = 0.8$ minutes; $E(W) = 3.0$ minutes, $\sigma_W = 1.2$ minutes. A customer's total time in the shop, $T$, is given by $T = C + W$. The shop also offers a premium service where the ordering time is reduced by 1 minute and then multiplied by 0.5. Let $C'$ be the ordering time for the premium service.</div>
