      <h2>FRQ 2</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A car manufacturer wants to model the relationship between the weight of a car (in hundreds of pounds) and its fuel efficiency (in miles per gallon, mpg). A random sample of 15 car models was selected. The least-squares regression line for predicting fuel efficiency from car weight is given by $\hat{y} = 45.1 - 0.86x$, where $\hat{y}$ is the predicted fuel efficiency and $x$ is the car weight (in hundreds of pounds). The correlation coefficient is $r = -0.78$.</div>

      <h2>FRQ 3</h2>

      <div class="prompt">An agricultural scientist is investigating the relationship between the amount of fertilizer applied to a crop (in kg per hectare) and the resulting crop yield (in tons per hectare). Data from 12 experimental plots were collected. The initial scatterplot showed a curved relationship. To linearize the relationship, the scientist applied a base-10 logarithmic transformation to the crop yield, using $\log_{10}(\text{yield})$. The least-squares regression line for predicting $\log_{10}(\text{yield})$ from fertilizer amount ($x$) is $\widehat{\log_{10}(\text{yield})} = 0.5 + 0.02x$.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        One data point from the original dataset was (50 kg, 0.8 tons). After transformation, this point is (50, $\log_{10}(0.8)$). Suppose this point significantly influences the regression line. Describe what "influential point" means in the context of this study.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        If the point (50, 0.8) were removed, how would you expect the slope of the least-squares regression line to change? Justify your answer.

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Using the given regression equation, predict the crop yield (in tons per hectare) for a fertilizer amount of 75 kg per hectare.

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): An influential point is an observation that, if removed, would significantly change the slope and/or y-intercept of the least-squares regression line.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Explains that the point (50 kg, 0.8 tons) with $\log_{10}(0.8) \approx -0.097$ has high leverage ($x=50$ is likely a high $x$-value) and a large negative residual (observed $\log_{10}(0.8)$ is much lower than predicted $\widehat{\log_{10}(\text{yield})} = 0.5 + 0.02(50) = 1.5$). Removing this point, which pulls the line down at its high $x$-value, would cause the slope to increase (become steeper).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Calculates $\widehat{\log_{10}(\text{yield})} = 0.5 + 0.02(75) = 2$, and correctly transforms back to $\text{yield} = 10^2 = 100$ tons per hectare.</li>
