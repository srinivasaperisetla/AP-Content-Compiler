      <div class="prompt">Researchers investigated the relationship between the amount of fertilizer applied (in grams per square meter, $x$) and the yield of a certain crop (in kilograms, $y$).

          <li>Part b (1pt): States that since the entire interval $(0.49125, 1.00875)$ is above zero, there is convincing evidence that increasing fertilizer leads to increased yield. Justifies by explaining the range of plausible values for the slope.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Explains that a larger sample size would lead to a larger degrees of freedom, which would result in a smaller $t$-critical value, thus narrowing the confidence interval (assuming $SE_{\hat{b}}$ remains the same due to other factors).</li>

          <li>Part c (1pt): Justifies the claim by comparing the p-value ($0.001$) to $\alpha=0.01$. Since $0.001 < 0.01$, we reject $H_0: \beta=0$, providing evidence of a linear relationship.</li>
