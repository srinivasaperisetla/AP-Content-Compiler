      <h2>FRQ 3</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A pharmaceutical company is testing a new drug for a common ailment. They claim the drug causes a certain side effect in only 5% of patients. A new batch of the drug is suspected to have a higher rate of this side effect.

        <ul>

          <li>Part b (1pt): A Type II error would occur if the researchers conclude that the new batch of drug does not cause the side effect in more than 5% of patients (fail to reject $H_0$), when in reality, the true proportion is actually greater than 5% ($H_a$ is true).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Changing $\alpha$ from 0.01 to 0.05 would increase the probability of a Type I error (it is now 0.05 instead of 0.01). This would decrease the probability of a Type II error, as it would be easier to reject the null hypothesis.</li>
