        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Calculates the $z$-scores for 1400 and 1650 hours. Uses the Normal distribution to find the correct proportion, showing calculation ($P(1400 < X < 1650) \approx 0.588$). ($z_{1400} = \frac{1400-1500}{150} \approx -0.67$. $z_{1650} = \frac{1650-1500}{150} = 1.00$. $P(-0.67 < Z < 1.00) \approx 0.588$).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Finds the $z$-score corresponding to the 5th percentile (or 95th percentile from the left). Uses the $z$-score to calculate the minimum lifespan, showing calculation. ($z \approx -1.645$. Minimum lifespan $\approx 1500 + (-1.645)(150) \approx 1253.25$ hours).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Calculates the $z$-score for each light bulb. Compares the $z$-scores and states which light bulb has a relatively longer lifespan. ($z_{\text{Brand 1}} = \frac{1700-1500}{150} \approx 1.33$. $z_{\text{Brand 2}} = \frac{1750-1600}{100} = 1.50$. Brand 2 light bulb has a relatively longer lifespan because its $z$-score (1.50) is higher than Brand 1's $z$-score (1.33)).</li>
