      <div class="prompt">A large university wants to conduct a survey to understand student satisfaction with on-campus housing facilities. There are 20,000 students living in 10 different dormitories. The university staff wants to select a sample of 200 students.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Describe how to select a simple random sample (SRS) of 200 students from all 20,000 students living in on-campus housing.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Explain one advantage of using a stratified random sample over an SRS in this context, where each dormitory is a stratum.

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Identify one potential source of bias if the university were to survey only students who volunteer to participate in the survey via an email link.

        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): Provides a clear, step-by-step description of how to select an SRS (e.g., assign numbers, use a random number generator).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Explains that a stratified random sample ensures representation from each dorm, which might reveal differences in satisfaction levels across dorms or reduce variability within estimates if dorms are different. It also explains how this is an advantage over SRS in this context.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Identifies voluntary response bias or nonresponse bias, and briefly explains how it might lead to over- or under-estimation of satisfaction.</li>

      <div class="prompt">Researchers are interested in whether regular consumption of green tea reduces the risk of heart disease.

      <h2>FRQ 3</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A pet food company wants to test a new dog food formula designed to improve coat health. They recruit 60 dogs of similar breed, age, and health condition for a study. Half of the dogs will receive the new formula, and the other half will receive their regular dog food for three months.

      <div class="part">

          <li>Part b (1pt): Explains that the control group provides a baseline for comparison to determine if the new formula has an effect beyond what might naturally occur or from other factors.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Describes a method for randomly assigning the 60 dogs to the two food groups, such as numbering the dogs from 1 to 60 and using a random number generator to select 30 for the new formula, with the remaining 30 receiving regular food.</li>

      <div class="prompt">An agricultural scientist wants to compare the effectiveness of two new organic pesticides (Pesticide A and Pesticide B) against a control (no pesticide) in preventing aphid infestations on tomato plants. They have 30 identical tomato plants.</div>

       
      <div class="part">

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Compare the two designs, explaining which design would be more appropriate for this study and justifying your choice.

      <div class="guidelines">
        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Describes a completely randomized design: random assignment of 30 plants to 3 treatment groups (10 plants per group: Pesticide A, Pesticide B, Control). For example, number plants 1-30, use a random number generator to select 10 for A, then 10 for B, remaining 10 for Control.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Describes a randomized block design: dividing the 30 plants into 3 blocks of 10 plants each (based on greenhouse section). Within each block, randomly assign the 3 treatments (Pesticide A, Pesticide B, Control) to an equal number of plants (e.g., 3-4 plants per treatment per block).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Compares the two designs, noting that the randomized block design (part b) is more appropriate because it accounts for the variability due to differing light conditions (blocking variable), reducing variability within treatment groups and making it easier to detect treatment effects. Justification should link blocking to controlling for a known source of variation.</li>

      <h2>FRQ 5</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A study was conducted to determine if a new teaching method significantly improves student test scores in mathematics compared to the traditional method. A well-designed randomized experiment was performed with two groups of students. After the study, the average test score for students using the new method was 85, and for the traditional method, it was 80. A statistical analysis reported a p-value of $0.015$.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Interpret the p-value of $0.015$ in the context of this study.

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Based on the p-value, what conclusion can be drawn about the effectiveness of the new teaching method at a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$? Justify your conclusion.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Can the researchers conclude that the new teaching method *caused* the observed improvement in test scores? Explain why or why not.

      <div class="guidelines">
        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): Interprets the p-value as the probability of observing a difference in average test scores as extreme as or more extreme than 5 points (85-80), assuming there is no actual difference between the new and traditional teaching methods.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Concludes that there is sufficient evidence to support that the new teaching method significantly improves test scores. Justifies this by stating that since $0.015 < 0.05$, the null hypothesis of no difference should be rejected.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): States that yes, causality can be concluded. Explains that because this was a well-designed randomized experiment, it controls for confounding variables, allowing for a cause-and-effect conclusion.</li>
