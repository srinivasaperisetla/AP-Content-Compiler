      <h2>FRQ 3</h2>

      <div class="prompt">An educational researcher wants to estimate the true mean score on a standardized test for all high school students in a large district. She considers two different methods: Method A uses the average score from a simple random sample of 50 students. Method B uses the average score from a convenience sample of 50 students from one particular high school. Assume the true mean score for the district is $\mu$.</div>

          <li>Part c (1pt): Describes that Method B, using a convenience sample from one school, could lead to selection bias, where students at that school might not be representative of all students in the district (e.g., higher or lower performing on average), causing the sample mean to consistently overestimate or underestimate $\mu$ (1pt).</li>
