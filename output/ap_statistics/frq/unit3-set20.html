      <div class="prompt">A high school principal wants to determine student opinion regarding a proposal to extend the school day by 30 minutes. There are 2000 students in the school.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Describe how the principal could use a simple random sample (SRS) of 200 students.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Describe how the principal could use a stratified random sample of 200 students, stratified by grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th grade). Explain an advantage of using stratified random sampling in this context.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Suppose the principal decides to survey students by placing a suggestion box near the main entrance for one week, asking students to drop in their opinions. Identify a potential source of bias in this sampling method and explain how it might affect the results.

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): Describes a correct SRS procedure (e.g., assign numbers to all students, use a random number generator to select 200 unique numbers, and survey the corresponding students).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Describes a correct stratified sampling procedure (e.g., divide students into four grade-level strata, take an SRS from each grade level proportionate to its size) AND explains an advantage (e.g., ensures representation from all grades, reduces variability in estimates, or allows for comparison between grades).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Identifies a source of bias (e.g., voluntary response bias, undercoverage, or non-response bias) AND explains how it would lead to over- or underestimation of the opinion for/against the proposal (e.g., only students with strong opinions, likely negative, would respond, skewing the results).</li>

      <div class="prompt">A company develops a new type of fertilizer designed to increase the yield of tomato plants. They want to compare the new fertilizer to their current best-selling fertilizer. They have 60 identical tomato plants available for the experiment.</div>

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Identifies the experimental units as the 60 tomato plants, the treatments as the new fertilizer and the current best-selling fertilizer, and the response variable as tomato plant yield (e.g., weight of tomatoes, number of tomatoes).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): Describes a method for randomly assigning the 60 plants to the two fertilizer groups (e.g., assign numbers 1-60 to plants, use a random number generator to select 30 plants for the new fertilizer, and the remaining 30 receive the current fertilizer).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Explains that the control group (the current fertilizer group, in this case) provides a baseline for comparison, allowing researchers to determine if the new fertilizer has an effect beyond what the standard fertilizer provides or any natural growth.</li>

      <h2>FRQ 4</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A university wants to study the effectiveness of two different teaching methods (Method A and Method B) for a challenging statistics course.

      <h2>FRQ 5</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A pharmaceutical company conducts a study to compare a new blood pressure medication (Drug X) with a placebo. They recruit 100 patients with high blood pressure. They randomly assign 50 patients to receive Drug X and 50 to receive a placebo. Nurses administering the medication are aware of which treatment each patient receives, but the patients are not. After three months, blood pressure measurements are taken.</div>

      <div class="part">

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): Identifies that the study uses single-blinding (patients are blind, but nurses are not).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Identifies that the nurses' knowledge of the treatment (lack of blinding for administrators) is a source of bias AND explains how it could influence results (e.g., nurses might unconsciously give more attention, encourage, or measure blood pressure differently for patients receiving Drug X, potentially inflating the observed effect).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): States that while a significant difference was found, the conclusion should be viewed with skepticism or caution AND explains that the identified bias might have exaggerated the perceived effect of Drug X, making it seem more effective than it truly is.</li>
