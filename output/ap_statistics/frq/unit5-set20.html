      <h2>FRQ 3</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A small town has a population of 1000 residents. Researchers are interested in estimating the average number of hours residents spend volunteering per week. They consider two different sampling methods to select 50 residents: Method A: Simple Random Sample (SRS) of 50 residents. The sample mean $\bar{x}$ is calculated. Method B: Stratified Random Sample where residents are divided into age groups (under 18, 18-65, over 65) and a proportional random sample is taken from each group. The sample mean $\bar{x}_{strat}$ is calculated. To understand the properties of these estimators, a simulation was run 1000 times for each method, assuming the true population mean volunteering hours is 4.5 hours. The means of the 1000 sample means for each method were recorded.</div>
