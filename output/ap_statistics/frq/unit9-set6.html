        <ul>

          <li>Part b (1pt): States that a linear model is appropriate (or not) and justifies the answer by referring to the residual plot (e.g., "A linear model is appropriate because the residual plot shows no discernible pattern, and the residuals are randomly scattered around zero.").</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Explains that a point with a very large diameter is a high-leverage point, and if its height is far below predicted, it would be an influential point that pulls the regression line (and thus the estimated slope) toward it. This would likely decrease the standard error of the slope, thus making the confidence interval for the slope narrower.</li>

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Explains that a significant positive linear relationship exists if the entire 95% confidence interval for the slope is above zero. If the lower bound is greater than zero, we are 95% confident that the true slope is positive, indicating a positive linear relationship.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Explains that a significance test for $H_0: \beta = 0$ versus $H_a: \beta > 0$ is conducted. If the p-value is less than the significance level ($\alpha$), then $H_0$ is rejected, providing evidence of a significant positive linear relationship. Defines $\beta$ as the true slope of the population regression line.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Explains that increasing the sample size ($n$) would increase the degrees of freedom ($n-2$) and decrease the standard error of the slope ($s_b$). A smaller standard error ($s_b$) leads to a smaller margin of error ($t^* \times s_b$) and thus a narrower confidence interval.</li>
