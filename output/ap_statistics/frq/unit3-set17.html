      <div class="prompt">A large high school wants to estimate the proportion of its 2000 students who plan to attend the upcoming prom. The principal suggests surveying the first 100 students who arrive at school on a specific Monday morning.</div>

       
      <div class="part">

        Identify the sampling method proposed by the principal.

      <div class="part">

          <li>Part c (2pts): Describes a simple random sample (SRS) or stratified random sample (1pt) AND explains a valid procedure for implementing it (e.g., assign each student a number and use a random number generator for SRS, or divide by grade level and take a proportional SRS from each grade for stratified) (1pt).</li>

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (3pts): Identifies the 300 volunteers as the experimental units (1pt) AND the medication/treatment (or dosage level) as the explanatory variable (1pt) AND the reduction in allergy symptoms (or symptom severity score) as the response variable (1pt).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Describes random assignment of volunteers to treatment groups (e.g., using a random number generator or drawing names from a hat to assign approximately 150 to medication and 150 to placebo) (1pt) AND describes double-blinding (neither the volunteers nor the researchers interacting with them know who receives the medication or placebo) (1pt).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Explains that a placebo group accounts for the placebo effect or provides a baseline for comparison against the active treatment.</li>

      <div class="prompt">A local city council wants to gauge public opinion on a proposal to build a new community center. They send a detailed online survey to all registered voters in the city.

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): Identifies a valid source of bias, such as voluntary response bias, nonresponse bias, or undercoverage (for voters without internet access or who don't regularly check email).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): Explains how the identified bias would systematically over- or underestimate the true public opinion (e.g., if voluntary response bias is identified, then only those with strong opinions (likely in favor or strongly against) will respond, potentially exaggerating the perceived support or opposition).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Proposes a specific, feasible modification to the survey method that would address the identified bias (e.g., for nonresponse/voluntary response, follow-up contacts via mail/phone, or offering incentives; for undercoverage, provide paper surveys or phone calls to a random sample) (1pt) AND explains how this modification would reduce the bias (1pt).</li>

        Explain one advantage of the matched-pairs design over the completely randomized design in this context.

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Describes randomly assigning the 100 associates to either Program A or Program B (50 in each group) (1pt) AND explains that sales performance will be measured for each group after the training (1pt).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Describes forming 50 pairs of associates based on a relevant characteristic (e.g., prior sales performance, experience level, or region) (1pt) AND within each pair, randomly assigning one associate to Program A and the other to Program B (1pt).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Explains that the matched-pairs design reduces variability in the response variable (sales) by controlling for individual differences between associates (or other extraneous variables controlled by pairing) (1pt), thereby increasing the power to detect a difference between programs if one exists (1pt).</li>
