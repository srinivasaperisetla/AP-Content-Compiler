      <h2>FRQ 1</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A large high school wants to survey its 2,000 students to gather opinions on a proposed change to the school's lunch menu. The school administration is considering two sampling methods: Method 1: Place a sign-up sheet in the cafeteria during lunch and survey the first 100 students who volunteer. Method 2: Obtain an alphabetical list of all students, assign each student a number from 1 to 2000, and use a random number generator to select 100 distinct student numbers to survey.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Identify the type of sampling method described in Method 1 and describe a potential source of bias associated with this method.

      <div class="prompt">A local city council wants to gauge public support for building a new community center. They decide to survey 200 residents. Method A: Send an email survey to all residents who are registered to vote and have an email address on file with the city. Method B: Conduct a telephone survey by calling 200 randomly selected phone numbers from the city's phone directory.

      <h2>FRQ 5</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A university conducted an experiment to determine if a new online study tool improves student performance in a challenging statistics course. 100 students enrolled in the course were randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group A used the new online study tool, and Group B used traditional study methods. At the end of the semester, the mean final exam score for Group A was $82.5$ points with a standard deviation of $8.2$ points, while for Group B, the mean final exam score was $78.1$ points with a standard deviation of $9.5$ points.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Based on these results, can the university conclude that using the new online study tool causes an improvement in student performance in this statistics course? Justify your answer.
