      <div class="prompt">A forester wants to estimate the relationship between a tree's height (in meters) and its trunk diameter (in centimeters). Data from a random sample of 30 trees were collected. The least-squares regression line is $\hat{y} = 1.2 + 0.5x$, where $x$ is diameter and $y$ is height. A computer output shows the standard error of the slope as $SE_b = 0.08$ and the degrees of freedom as $df = 28$.</div>

      <h2>FRQ 3</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A company is studying the relationship between its monthly advertising expenditures (in thousands of dollars) and its monthly sales (in thousands of units). A 90% confidence interval for the true slope of the regression line relating sales to advertising expenditures is $(0.85, 1.25)$.</div>

       
      <div class="part">

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        The company claims that for every additional thousand dollars spent on advertising, sales increase by at least 1000 units. Justify whether this claim is supported by the confidence interval.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Describe how increasing the sample size (number of months) used to construct the confidence interval would affect the width of the interval, assuming all other factors remain constant.

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): We are 90% confident that for every additional thousand dollars spent on advertising, the true mean increase in monthly sales is between 0.85 thousand units and 1.25 thousand units.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): Since the entire interval $(0.85, 1.25)$ is above 1 (which represents a 1000-unit increase per thousand dollars), the claim that sales increase by at least 1000 units per thousand dollars of advertising is supported.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Increasing the sample size would generally decrease the standard error of the slope, leading to a smaller margin of error and thus a narrower confidence interval.</li>

      <h2>FRQ 5</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A farming company is investigating the relationship between the amount of fertilizer applied (in kg per acre) and the resulting crop yield (in bushels per acre). For a random sample of 40 plots, a linear regression model was fitted. The estimated slope is $b = 5.2$ and its standard error is $SE_b = 2.1$. The degrees of freedom are 38. A significance test for the slope resulted in a p-value of 0.019.</div>

          <li>Part c (1pt): Since the p-value of $0.019 < \alpha = 0.05$, we reject the null hypothesis. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant linear relationship between the amount of fertilizer applied and crop yield.</li>
