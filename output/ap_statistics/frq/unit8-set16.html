      <h2>FRQ 4</h2>

      <div class="prompt">When conducting a chi-square test for goodness-of-fit or for homogeneity/independence, it is crucial to understand the properties of the chi-square distribution and the conditions under which the test is valid.</div>

        <ul>

          <li>Part b (1pt): Explains that the condition requires all expected counts to be at least 5 (or sometimes 10) and justifies its importance by noting that the chi-square distribution approximates the sampling distribution of the test statistic only when expected counts are sufficiently large.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Explains that an expected count of $2.3$ violates the large sample size condition (expected counts $\ge 5$), which means the chi-square approximation for the sampling distribution may not be accurate, leading to an unreliable p-value and potentially an incorrect conclusion.</li>
