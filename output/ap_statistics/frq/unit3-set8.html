      <div class="prompt">A large high school wants to survey its 2,000 students to gather opinions on a proposed change to the school's lunch menu. The administration decides to ask the first 100 students who enter the cafeteria on a specific day.</div>

       
      <div class="part">

          <li>Part a (1pt): Identifies the sampling method as convenience sampling.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Explains that convenience sampling is inappropriate because it's not representative, as students entering the cafeteria early may have different opinions than the rest of the student body. Describes bias (e.g., overrepresentation of students who eat lunch, underrepresentation of students who bring lunch or eat late, leading to skewed opinions).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Describes a correct procedure for obtaining an SRS (e.g., assign each of the 2,000 students a unique number from 1 to 2000, use a random number generator to select 100 unique numbers, and survey the students corresponding to those numbers).</li>

      <h2>FRQ 2</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A pharmaceutical company is developing a new nasal spray to alleviate allergy symptoms. To test its effectiveness, they recruit 200 volunteers who suffer from seasonal allergies. Half of the volunteers are randomly assigned to receive the new nasal spray, while the other half receive a placebo nasal spray. Researchers then monitor and record the severity of each volunteer's allergy symptoms over a two-week period.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Identify the type of study conducted by the pharmaceutical company (observational study or experiment). Justify your answer.

      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        If the company had instead conducted an observational study by simply asking allergy sufferers whether they use nasal spray and then comparing their symptom severity, describe a potential confounding variable and explain how it could affect the observed results.
      </div>
       
      <div class="guidelines">
        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): Identifies the study as an experiment and justifies by stating that treatments (new nasal spray vs. placebo) were actively imposed on randomly assigned subjects.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Identifies experimental units as the 200 volunteers, treatments as the new nasal spray and the placebo nasal spray, and the response variable as the severity of allergy symptoms.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Describes a potential confounding variable (e.g., severity of allergies, use of other allergy medications, environmental exposure) and explains how it could affect the observed results (e.g., people with more severe allergies might be more likely to seek out and use nasal sprays, or people using other medications might report lower symptom severity regardless of nasal spray use, making it difficult to isolate the effect of the nasal spray).</li>

      <div class="prompt">A company that produces car tires wants to determine if a new rubber compound (Compound A) significantly improves tire longevity compared to their standard compound (Compound B). They plan to test 40 new tires in a controlled experiment using 20 identical cars. Each car will be driven for 50,000 miles under similar conditions.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Describe how the principle of random assignment should be implemented in this experiment.

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Explain the purpose of using random assignment in this context.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Describe how the principle of control is incorporated into this experimental design to ensure a fair comparison between the two rubber compounds.

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): Describes random assignment (e.g., for each car, randomly assign two tires to have Compound A and two tires to have Compound B, or randomly assign which of the 20 cars gets all Compound A tires and which gets Compound B tires).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): Explains that random assignment helps to create groups that are roughly equivalent with respect to all other factors (known or unknown) that might affect tire longevity, thus minimizing the effects of confounding variables and allowing for inference about causation.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Describes how control is used (e.g., using identical cars, driving for the same mileage, under similar conditions, comparing to a standard compound/control group) to minimize variation and isolate the effect of the rubber compound.</li>

      <div class="prompt">A team of researchers analyzed existing health records of 50,000 adults over a 10-year period.

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Based on this study, can the researchers conclude that consuming leafy green vegetables causes a reduction in heart disease? Explain why or why not.

      <div class="guidelines">
        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): Identifies the study as an observational study because the researchers merely observed existing habits and health outcomes without imposing any treatments.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Explains that a cause-and-effect relationship cannot be concluded because observational studies do not control for confounding variables. Other factors (e.g., overall healthy lifestyle, socioeconomic status, exercise habits) might be associated with both leafy green vegetable consumption and lower heart disease risk, making it impossible to isolate the effect of vegetables alone.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Identifies appropriate generalizations (e.g., a strong association or correlation exists between consuming leafy green vegetables and a lower incidence of heart disease in the population from which the records were drawn, but not causation).</li>

      <h2>FRQ 5</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A consumer organization wants to compare the fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) of two new types of gasoline additive, Additive X and Additive Y. They have 10 test cars available, consisting of 5 compact cars and 5 large SUVs. It is known that compact cars generally get much better fuel efficiency than large SUVs.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Explain why a completely randomized design, where each of the 10 cars is randomly assigned to receive either Additive X or Additive Y, might not be the most appropriate design for this experiment.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Describe how the organization could implement a blocked experimental design to compare the two additives, addressing the concern mentioned in part (a).
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Justify the benefit of using the blocked design described in part (b) in this specific context.
      </div>
       
      <div class="guidelines">
        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): Explains that a completely randomized design might lead to groups of cars (Additive X vs. Additive Y) that are not balanced with respect to car type (compact vs. SUV), leading to confounding since car type is known to strongly affect fuel efficiency.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Describes a blocked design: The cars should be blocked by type (compact cars and large SUVs). Within each block, randomly assign half of the cars to receive Additive X and the other half to receive Additive Y. For example, randomly assign 2 or 3 compact cars to X and the remaining compact cars to Y, and similarly for SUVs, ensuring equal numbers in each treatment group within each block.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Justifies the benefit: Blocking by car type reduces the variability within treatment groups that is attributable to differences in car type. This makes the comparison between Additive X and Additive Y more precise and allows for a clearer detection of any true difference in fuel efficiency due to the additives, as the effect of car type is accounted for.</li>
