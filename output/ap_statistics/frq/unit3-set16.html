      <h2>FRQ 2</h2>

      <div class="prompt">Researchers are interested in whether regular exercise reduces the risk of heart disease. They recruit 1,000 adults and collect data on their exercise habits, diet, and medical history over 10 years. At the end of the study, they compare the incidence of heart disease between those who exercised regularly and those who did not.</div>

      <div class="prompt">A pharmaceutical company developed a new drug to lower blood pressure. They want to test its effectiveness compared to a placebo. They recruit 200 volunteers with high blood pressure and plan to administer the new drug to half of them and a placebo to the other half for three months.

      <h2>FRQ 4</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A food scientist wants to compare the effectiveness of two different food preservation methods (Method A and Method B) on extending the shelf life of a new type of fruit. They have 200 fruits available for the study.</div>

       
      <div class="part">

        Describe a completely randomized design for this experiment.

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Describe a matched-pairs design for this experiment. Explain why a matched-pairs design might be more appropriate than a completely randomized design in this context.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Suppose the scientists use a completely randomized design and find that Method A results in a significantly longer shelf life ($p < 0.01$) compared to Method B. Interpret this result in the context of the study.

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): Describes random assignment of 100 fruits to Method A and 100 fruits to Method B, followed by shelf life measurement for each fruit.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Describes matching fruits based on a characteristic (e.g., ripeness, size) into 100 pairs, randomly assigning Method A to one fruit in each pair and Method B to the other, then comparing within pairs. Explains that matched pairs reduce variability due to confounding factors, making it easier to detect a difference between methods.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Interprets $p < 0.01$ as meaning there is strong evidence that Method A causes a longer shelf life for this type of fruit than Method B, and this difference is unlikely to occur by random chance if there were no actual difference.</li>

      <h2>FRQ 5</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A university housing office wants to estimate the proportion of students who are satisfied with their on-campus housing. There are 10,000 students living in 10 different dormitories on campus.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Describe a method for selecting a simple random sample (SRS) of 500 students from the 10,000 students living in campus housing. Assume you have a complete list of all students living in campus housing.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Describe an advantage of using a stratified random sample, rather than an SRS, to estimate the proportion of satisfied students. Explain how you would implement a stratified random sample in this context.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Suppose the housing office sends an email survey to all 10,000 students. Identify and describe one potential source of bias that could arise from this data collection method.

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>

          <li>Part b (2pts): Describes that stratified random sampling ensures representation from each dormitory (stratum), potentially reducing variability in the estimate. Explains implementation by sampling a proportional number of students from each of the 10 dormitories (strata).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Identifies voluntary response bias or nonresponse bias and describes how it would affect the estimate (e.g., only very satisfied or very dissatisfied students might respond, leading to an overestimation or underestimation of overall satisfaction).</li>
