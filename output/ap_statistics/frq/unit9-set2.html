      <h2>FRQ 2</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A company claims that its new fertilizer significantly increases crop yield, specifically that the true average increase in crop yield is greater than $0.5$ kg for each additional gram of fertilizer applied. To test this claim, a botanist applies different amounts of fertilizer (in grams, $x$) to 50 identical plants and measures the crop yield (in kilograms, $y$). A linear regression analysis was performed, yielding the following results: Estimated slope: $b = 0.65$, Standard error of the slope: $SE_b = 0.08$, Degrees of freedom: $df = 48$. A scatterplot showed a reasonably linear relationship, residuals were approximately normal, and variability was constant.</div>
