        Interpret the 90% confidence interval in the context of this study. \n b. A homeowner claims that for every 1-degree Fahrenheit increase in temperature, electricity consumption decreases by exactly 0.5 kWh. Based on the confidence interval, does this claim seem plausible?

      <div class="prompt">A large car dealership is interested in the relationship between the advertised price of a used car (in thousands of dollars, $x$) and the number of days it stays on the lot until sold ($y$). A random sample of 40 used cars was selected, and a linear regression was performed. The $p$-value for the test of $H_0: \beta = 0$ versus $H_a: \beta \ne 0$ was found to be $0.082$.

Based on the $p$-value, what conclusion can be drawn at the $\alpha = 0.05$ significance level regarding the relationship between advertised price and days on the lot? Justify your answer. \n c. Suppose a colleague claims that there is no linear relationship between advertised price and days on the lot. Would your conclusion in part (b) support or contradict this claim? Explain your reasoning.

        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): Assuming there is no linear relationship between car price and days on the lot, there is an 8.2% chance of observing a sample slope as extreme as or more extreme than $0.75$ (or $-0.75$) due to random sampling variability alone. (1pt for correct interpretation with context). \n Part b (2pts): Since the $p$-value ($0.082$) $> \alpha$ ($0.05$), we fail to reject $H_0$ (1pt). There is not sufficient evidence to conclude a significant linear relationship between the advertised price of a used car and the number of days it stays on the lot (1pt for conclusion in context). \n Part c (1pt): My conclusion in part (b) would support the colleague's claim (0.5pt) because failing to reject the null hypothesis ($H_0: \beta = 0$) means we do not have enough evidence to say there *is* a linear relationship.

          <li>Part a (1pt): A linear model appears appropriate because the scatterplot shows a generally positive linear trend with no strong curvature (1pt for explanation based on scatterplot). \n Part b (1pt): The residual plot shows no clear fanning-out or fanning-in pattern and points are randomly scattered around zero, indicating that the variance of the residuals appears to be relatively constant across the range of Vitamin C intake, thus meeting the constant variance condition (1pt for explanation based on residual plot). \n Part c (1pt): The assumption of approximately normally distributed residuals is important because it ensures that the sampling distribution of the slope estimate is approximately a $t$-distribution, which is used to construct confidence intervals and perform hypothesis tests for the slope. If residuals are not normal, the $t$-procedures may not be valid, especially for small sample sizes. (1pt for explanation).</li>
