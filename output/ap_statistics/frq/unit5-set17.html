        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (3pts): Shape is approximately normal because conditions $n\hat{p} \ge 10$ and $n(1-\hat{p}) \ge 10$ are met ($150 \times 0.70 = 105 \ge 10$ and $150 \times 0.30 = 45 \ge 10$). Mean is $0.70$. Standard deviation is $\sqrt{\frac{0.70(1-0.70)}{150}} \approx 0.0374$.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Calculates $z$-score $\frac{0.65 - 0.70}{0.0374} \approx -1.33$. Uses $P(Z \le -1.33)$ to find probability $\approx 0.0918$.</li>

      <div class="prompt">The weight of adult male grizzly bears in a certain region is approximately normally distributed with a mean of $790$ pounds and a standard deviation of $105$ pounds. Wildlife biologists plan to capture and weigh a random sample of $36$ adult male grizzly bears.</div>

       
      <div class="part">

        A wildlife sanctuary has claimed that the average weight of male grizzly bears in their care is significantly lower than the regional average. Based on your answer in part (b), would a sample mean weight of $750$ pounds for $36$ bears provide strong evidence to support this claim? Justify your answer.

      <div class="guidelines">
        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (3pts): Shape is approximately normal because the population is normally distributed. Mean is $790$ pounds. Standard deviation is $\frac{105}{\sqrt{36}} = \frac{105}{6} = 17.5$ pounds.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Calculates $z$-score $\frac{750 - 790}{17.5} \approx -2.29$. Uses $P(Z \le -2.29)$ to find probability $\approx 0.0110$.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Yes, a probability of $0.0110$ is quite small, indicating that a sample mean of $750$ pounds would be unusual if the true mean were $790$ pounds, thus providing strong evidence against the claim that the sanctuary bears are similar to the regional average.</li>

        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Mean of $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$ is $p_1 - p_2 = 0.52 - 0.40 = 0.12$. Standard deviation is $\sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.52(0.48)}{200} + \frac{0.40(0.60)}{150}} \approx \sqrt{0.001248 + 0.0016} \approx \sqrt{0.002848} \approx 0.0534$.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Verifies conditions for both samples: $n_1 p_1 = 200(0.52) = 104 \ge 10$, $n_1(1-p_1) = 200(0.48) = 96 \ge 10$. $n_2 p_2 = 150(0.40) = 60 \ge 10$, $n_2(1-p_2) = 150(0.60) = 90 \ge 10$. All are $\ge 10$, so approx. normal is appropriate.</li>

      <div class="prompt">A polling organization wants to estimate the proportion of registered voters who support a certain ballot measure. They take a simple random sample of $400$ registered voters and find that $220$ of them support the measure.</div>

      <div class="guidelines">
        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): The point estimate for the population proportion $p$ is the sample proportion $\hat{p} = \frac{220}{400} = 0.55$.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): An estimator is unbiased if, in the long run, the mean of its sampling distribution is equal to the true population parameter being estimated. For the sample proportion $\hat{p}$, this means that the expected value of $\hat{p}$ is equal to the population proportion $p$.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): If the estimator consistently overestimates the true proportion by $0.03$, then in repeated sampling, the average of the estimates would be $p+0.03$ instead of $p$. This would lead to systematically incorrect conclusions about the true population proportion, consistently suggesting higher support for the measure than actually exists.</li>

      <div class="prompt">The amount of soda dispensed by a vending machine is normally distributed with a mean of $16.2$ ounces and a standard deviation of $0.15$ ounces. The machine is set to dispense $16$ ounces per cup. A student runs a simulation by taking $1000$ random samples of $5$ cups each and calculating the mean amount dispensed for each sample.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Calculate the probability that a single cup dispenses less than $16$ ounces of soda.

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Describe how the sampling distribution of the sample mean for samples of size $5$ would differ from the distribution of individual cup amounts. Focus on shape, mean, and standard deviation.

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Calculates $z$-score for a single cup: $Z = \frac{16 - 16.2}{0.15} \approx -1.33$. Probability $P(X < 16) \approx P(Z < -1.33) \approx 0.0918$.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (3pts): The shape of the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ would also be normal because the population is normal, even for $n=5$. The mean of the sampling distribution would be the same as the population mean, $\mu_{\bar{x}} = 16.2$ ounces. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution would be smaller than the population standard deviation, $\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{0.15}{\sqrt{5}} \approx 0.067$ ounces.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): A simulation might be used to confirm theoretical properties of the sampling distribution, especially for smaller sample sizes or when the population distribution might be unknown or non-normal, to see how the sample means behave. While the population is normal here, simulation can reinforce understanding or explore scenarios where the theory is less straightforward.</li>
