      <div class="prompt">A researcher wants to investigate the relationship between the daily temperature (in degrees Celsius) and the number of kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity consumed by a small business. Data were collected for 15 randomly selected days. A linear regression model was fitted to the data, yielding a regression equation $\hat{y} = 150 + 5x$, where $x$ is the daily temperature and $\hat{y}$ is the predicted electricity consumption. The standard error of the slope coefficient was calculated to be $s_b = 1.2$.</div>

      <h2>FRQ 2</h2>

      <div class="prompt">An educational researcher is studying the relationship between the number of hours students spend on a new online learning platform per week and their final exam scores in a statistics course. Based on a sample of 25 students, a 90% confidence interval for the true slope of the regression line relating hours on platform to exam score was calculated as $(1.8, 3.5)$.</div>

        Interpret the 90% confidence interval $(1.8, 3.5)$ in the context of this study.

          <li>Part b (2pts): States "Yes, there is convincing evidence." (1pt) and justifies by noting that the entire interval $(1.8, 3.5)$ is above $0$, meaning a $0$ slope (no relationship) is not a plausible value. (1pt)</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Explains that increasing the sample size would generally lead to a narrower confidence interval because it typically decreases the standard error of the slope, which reduces the margin of error.</li>
