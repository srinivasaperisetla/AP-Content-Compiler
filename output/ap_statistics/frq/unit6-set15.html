        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Correctly describes Type I error (rejecting $H_0$ when $H_0$ is true: concluding defect rate is higher than 5% when it's not) and its consequence (e.g., unfairly damages manufacturer's reputation, costly recall). Correctly describes Type II error (failing to reject $H_0$ when $H_a$ is true: concluding defect rate is not higher than 5% when it is) and its consequence (e.g., consumers get defective batteries, loss of consumer trust, safety issues).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): Explains that reducing $\alpha$ to 0.01 would decrease the probability of a Type I error (because it requires stronger evidence to reject $H_0$). Explains that this would increase the probability of a Type II error (as it's harder to reject $H_0$ even when $H_a$ is true).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Identifies an increased sample size (e.g., sampling more batteries) AND explains that a larger sample size reduces the standard error, making the test more sensitive to detect a true difference, thus increasing power.</li>
