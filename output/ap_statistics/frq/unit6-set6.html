          <li>Part c (2pts): Correctly calculates p-hat = 280/500 = 0.56. Calculates the confidence interval using the formula p-hat +/- z*sqrt(p-hat(1-p-hat)/n) = 0.56 +/- 1.96*sqrt(0.56*0.44/500) = 0.56 +/- 0.0438, resulting in (0.5162, 0.6038).</li>

          <li>Part e (1pt): States that the politician can claim more than 50% support because the entire interval (0.5162, 0.6038) is above 0.50.</li>

          <li>Part c (2pts): Calculates p-hat = 110/150 = 0.733. Calculates test statistic z = (0.733 - 0.80) / sqrt(0.80*0.20/150) = -0.067 / sqrt(0.16/150) = -0.067 / sqrt(0.001067) = -0.067 / 0.03266 = -2.05 (approx) and finds p-value (approx 0.0202 using z = -2.05).</li>
          
          <li>Part d (1pt): Interprets p-value as the probability of observing a sample proportion as low as 0.733 or lower, assuming the true proportion of light bulbs lasting over 1,000 hours is 0.80.</li>
          
          <li>Part e (1pt): Concludes to reject H0 because p-value (0.0202) < alpha (0.05). Provides evidence that the true proportion of light bulbs lasting longer than 1,000 hours is less than 0.80.</li>
