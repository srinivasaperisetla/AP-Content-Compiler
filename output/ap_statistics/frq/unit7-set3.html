      <h2>FRQ 3</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A company developing a new ergonomic keyboard wants to determine if it significantly improves typing speed compared to a standard keyboard. They recruit $12$ professional typists and have each typist type a standard passage on both the new ergonomic keyboard and their usual standard keyboard. The order in which the keyboards are used is randomized for each typist. The typing speeds (words per minute) are recorded for each typist on each keyboard. The differences in typing speed (New Keyboard - Standard Keyboard) are calculated for each typist. The sample mean difference is $5.3$ words per minute, and the sample standard deviation of the differences is $3.8$ words per minute.

          <li>Part a (1pt): Explains that a matched-pairs design is used because each typist serves as their own control, reducing variability and allowing comparison of the two keyboards for the same individual (1pt).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): States correct null and alternative hypotheses and defines $\mu_d$ (1pt). $H_0: \mu_d = 0$, $H_a: \mu_d > 0$, where $\mu_d$ is the true mean difference in typing speed (New - Standard) for professional typists.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Verifies conditions: Random assignment of keyboard order for each typist ensures independence of differences (or random sample of typists); Differences are from a normal population or sample size is large enough (stated no strong skewness/outliers for $n=12$, which is reasonable for t-procedures). (1pt)</li>
          
          <li>Part d (3pts): Calculates the correct test statistic (1pt); Calculates the correct p-value (1pt); States the correct conclusion in context with justification (1pt). Test statistic: $t = \frac{\bar{d} - 0}{s_d/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{5.3 - 0}{3.8/\sqrt{12}} = \frac{5.3}{1.0969} \approx 4.832$. Degrees of freedom $df = 11$. P-value: $P(t > 4.832) < 0.001$. Conclusion: Since p-value ($< 0.001$) is less than $\alpha = 0.01$, we reject the null hypothesis. There is strong evidence that the new ergonomic keyboard significantly improves typing speed for professional typists.</li>

A random sample of $25$ individuals follows Plan A for three months, and another independent random sample of $28$ individuals follows Plan B for three months. The weight loss (in pounds) for each individual is recorded. For Plan A: $\bar{x}_A = 12.8$ pounds, $s_A = 3.5$ pounds. For Plan B: $\bar{x}_B = 10.1$ pounds, $s_B = 4.2$ pounds.

          <li>Part b (2pts): Calculates the correct t-statistic critical value and margin of error (1pt); States the correct confidence interval (1pt). Calculation: $(\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B) \pm t^* \sqrt{\frac{s_A^2}{n_A} + \frac{s_B^2}{n_B}}$. $df \approx \min(n_A-1, n_B-1) = 24$. For $90\%$ CI, $t^*_{0.05,24} \approx 1.711$. Diff: $12.8 - 10.1 = 2.7$. SE: $\sqrt{\frac{3.5^2}{25} + \frac{4.2^2}{28}} = \sqrt{0.49 + 0.63} = \sqrt{1.12} \approx 1.058$. Interval: $2.7 \pm 1.711(1.058) = 2.7 \pm 1.810 = (0.890, 4.510)$.</li>

          <li>Part d (1pt): Makes a correct conclusion and justification (1pt). Since the $90\%$ confidence interval $(0.890, 4.510)$ does not contain $0$, there is convincing evidence of a significant difference in mean weight loss between the two diet plans at the $0.10$ significance level.
