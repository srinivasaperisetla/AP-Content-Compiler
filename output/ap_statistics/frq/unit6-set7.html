      <h2>FRQ 3</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A hospital administrator wants to determine if the proportion of patients who receive timely discharge instructions is at least 90 percent. They plan to conduct a significance test using a random sample of patient records.</div>

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Type I error: Concluding that the proportion of patients receiving timely discharge instructions is less than 90% when it is actually 90% or more (rejecting $H_0$ when $H_0$ is true). Type II error: Concluding that the proportion of patients receiving timely discharge instructions is 90% or more when it is actually less than 90% (failing to reject $H_0$ when $H_a$ is true).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): A Type I error is not possible because the true proportion is $p = 0.88$, which means the alternative hypothesis ($H_a: p < 0.90$) is true. A Type II error is possible because we would fail to reject $H_0$ (conclude $p \ge 0.90$) when the alternative hypothesis is actually true ($p = 0.88 < 0.90$).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Increasing the sample size would decrease the probability of a Type II error. A larger sample size leads to a narrower sampling distribution of the sample proportion, which increases the power of the test to detect a true difference and thus reduces the chance of failing to reject a false null hypothesis.</li>

Calculates the confidence interval $\hat{p}_A - \hat{p}_B \pm z^* \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_A(1-\hat{p}_A)}{n_A} + \frac{\hat{p}_B(1-\hat{p}_B)}{n_B}} = (0.85 - 0.80) \pm 1.645 \sqrt{\frac{0.85(0.15)}{200} + \frac{0.80(0.20)}{250}} \approx 0.05 \pm 0.0628$, resulting in $(-0.0128, 0.1128)$.</li>
