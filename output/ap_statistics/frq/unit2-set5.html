      <div class="prompt">A study investigated the relationship between the average daily temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) and the number of ice cream cones sold at a local shop. For a sample of 10 days, the following summary statistics were calculated: $\bar{x} = 75^\circ F$, $s_x = 8^\circ F$, $\bar{y} = 150$ cones, $s_y = 30$ cones.

      <div class="prompt">A marine biologist is studying the relationship between the length (in cm) and weight (in grams) of a certain species of fish. For a sample of 12 fish with lengths ranging from 40 cm to 70 cm, the least-squares regression line was determined to be $\hat{y} = -240 + 5.5x$, where $x$ is the length in cm and $\hat{y}$ is the predicted weight in grams.

          <li>Part c (2pts): States that it is not appropriate (or likely not appropriate) because 10 cm is outside the range of observed lengths used to build the model (extrapolation), which might lead to unreliable or inaccurate predictions.</li>

      <h2>FRQ 5</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A company analyzed the relationship between the amount of money spent on advertising (in thousands of dollars) and the resulting sales (in millions of dollars) for their new product over 10 months. The least-squares regression line was calculated as $\hat{S} = 0.5 + 2.0A$, where $A$ is advertising spending and $S$ is sales.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        For one month, the company spent $A = \$3$ thousand on advertising and had actual sales of $S = \$7.2$ million. Calculate the residual for this month.

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        A residual plot for the 10 months showed a distinct U-shaped pattern. What does this pattern suggest about the appropriateness of a linear model for these data?

          <li>Part b (2pts): Explains that a U-shaped pattern in the residual plot indicates that a linear model is not appropriate, as there is a non-linear pattern remaining in the residuals, suggesting a curved relationship between advertising and sales.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Classifies the point as an influential point. Justifies by explaining that its inclusion significantly changes the slope of the regression line and affects the overall fit ($R^2$), which are characteristics of influential points.</li>
