A consumer advocacy group suspects that the average battery life is less than 24 hours.

      <h2>FRQ 5</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A tire manufacturer wants to compare the tread wear of two different rubber compounds, Compound A and Compound B. Instead of using two separate groups of cars, they decide to use 10 cars and install one tire made with Compound A and one tire made with Compound B on the rear wheels of each car (randomly assigning sides). After 20,000 miles, the tread wear (in mm) for each tire is measured, and the difference (Compound A - Compound B) is calculated for each car. The differences are: 1.2, 0.8, -0.1, 0.5, 0.3, 1.0, 0.6, 0.7, 0.2, 0.4. The mean difference is $\bar{x}_d = 0.56$ mm and the standard deviation of the differences is $s_d = 0.38$ mm.</div>

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): A paired t-procedure is appropriate because the measurements are taken on the same cars, creating dependent (paired) observations. This controls for car-to-car variability.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): Conditions for paired t-interval: Random assignment of tires to sides of cars for each pair, which ensures independence of differences (implicit in random assignment within pairs) (given). $n=10 < 30$, so check normality of differences (assume approximately normal as sample not extremely skewed, or note need for larger sample/normality check) (1pt).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Calculates $df=9$ and critical $t^*=1.833$ (1pt). Constructs interval $0.56 \pm 1.833 \left(\frac{0.38}{\sqrt{10}}\right) = 0.56 \pm 0.220 = (0.340, 0.780)$ mm (1pt).</li>
          
          <li>Part d (1pt): Yes, there is convincing evidence. Since the entire 90% confidence interval $(0.340, 0.780)$ is above 0, it suggests that Compound A has a significantly higher mean tread wear (less wear) than Compound B.</li>
