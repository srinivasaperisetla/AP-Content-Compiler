      <div class="prompt">A certain brand of cereal claims that $30\%$ of its boxes contain a prize for "Category A," $40\%$ for "Category B," $20\%$ for "Category C," and $10\%$ for "Category D." A consumer advocacy group suspects that the actual distribution of prizes is different. To investigate this, they randomly select $200$ boxes of cereal and find the following distribution of prizes.</div>

      <h2>FRQ 4</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A statistics student is designing a study to investigate if the distribution of birth months in a local hospital's records differs significantly from a uniform distribution (where each month has an equal chance).

          <li>Part b (1pt): Explains that the chi-square test statistic is an approximation of a sampling distribution, and this approximation is valid only when expected counts are large enough (typically $\ge 5$) to ensure the shape of the sampling distribution is adequately approximated by the theoretical chi-square distribution.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): If observed counts are very close to expected counts, the chi-square test statistic would be small, close to 0.</li>
          
          <li>Part d (1pt): Interprets the p-value in context: Assuming the true distribution of birth months is uniform, there is a $15\%$ chance of observing a chi-square test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the one calculated from the sample data.</li>
