      <h2>FRQ 4</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A company is developing a new training program for its employees to improve productivity. They have 60 employees available for a study and want to compare the new program (Program A) to their current program (Program B). The company believes that employee experience level might affect the outcome, so they categorize employees into "experienced" and "new" (30 in each category).</div>

      <h2>FRQ 5</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A local town council wants to estimate the proportion of its adult residents who support building a new community center. They decide to mail surveys to 1,000 randomly selected addresses in the town. Only 150 surveys are returned.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Identify two potential sources of bias in this study. For each source, explain how it might affect the estimated proportion of support for the new community center.

        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        The town council calculates the proportion of support from the returned surveys to be $\hat{p} = 0.70$. They then publicly announce that "70% of town residents support the new community center." Based on your answer to part (a), explain why this conclusion might be misleading.

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>

          <li>Part a (2pts): Identifies two distinct sources of bias (e.g., nonresponse bias, undercoverage if mailing lists are incomplete) AND for each, explains how it would lead to an over- or under-estimation (e.g., those who return surveys are more likely to support the center, leading to overestimation).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): Explains that the conclusion is misleading because of the identified biases, which mean the sample of respondents is not representative of all residents.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Describes a method to reduce nonresponse (e.g., follow-up reminders, incentives, shorter survey, face-to-face interviews for non-respondents).</li>
