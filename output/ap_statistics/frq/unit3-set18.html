      <h2>FRQ 1</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A large high school wants to estimate the proportion of students who prefer a later start time for classes. The principal proposes two methods for gathering data. Method 1: Randomly select 10 classes and survey all students in those classes. Method 2: Put an announcement in the daily bulletin asking students to visit a specific website to fill out a survey.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        For Method 1, identify the sampling method used.

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Explain why Method 1 is an appropriate sampling method for this scenario.

      <h2>FRQ 2</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A pharmaceutical company wants to test a new drug designed to lower blood pressure. They recruit 200 volunteers with high blood pressure and randomly assign them to two groups. One group receives the new drug, and the other receives a placebo. Neither the patients nor the doctors administering the drug know which treatment each patient is receiving. Blood pressure is measured after two months.</div>

          <li>Part b (1pt): Explains that the placebo controls for the placebo effect, where patients might show improvement simply because they believe they are receiving treatment, even if it has no active ingredient.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Describes that a double-blind procedure prevents bias from both the subjects' expectations and the researchers'/doctors' expectations regarding the drug's effectiveness.</li>

      <h2>FRQ 3</h2>

      <div class="prompt">Researchers conducted a study to investigate the relationship between screen time (hours spent on electronic devices) and academic performance (measured by GPA) among high school students. They collected data from a random sample of 500 high school students, recording their average daily screen time and their current GPA.</div>

        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Can the researchers conclude that increased screen time causes a decrease in academic performance? Justify your answer.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>

          <li>Part b (2pts): States that causation cannot be concluded (1pt) AND justifies by explaining that observational studies cannot establish cause-and-effect relationships because confounding variables are not controlled or accounted for (1pt).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Explains that the results can be generalized (1pt) because a random sample of high school students was used, which allows for generalization to the population from which the sample was drawn (all high school students).</li>

      <div class="prompt">A local supermarket wants to understand customer satisfaction with their new self-checkout system.

          <li>Part b (2pts): For voluntary response bias, explains that customers with strong opinions (very satisfied or very dissatisfied) are more likely to respond, potentially over- or under-estimating true satisfaction (1pt). For undercoverage/convenience sampling, explains that the sample might not be representative of all customers, or only those who use self-checkout, leading to a skewed estimate of overall customer satisfaction (1pt).</li>

      <h2>FRQ 5</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A university housing department wants to estimate the proportion of residents who are interested in a new meal plan option. There are 50 dormitories on campus, each housing approximately 100 students. Plan A: Randomly select 5 dormitories and survey every student in those 5 dormitories. Plan B: Obtain a list of all students living on campus and randomly select 500 students from the list to survey.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        For each plan, identify the specific type of random sampling method described.

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Identifies Plan A as cluster sampling (1pt) and Plan B as simple random sampling (1pt).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): Explains that Plan B ensures a greater chance of representation from all dormitories/types of students, reducing potential variability or bias from specific dorm clusters, leading to a more precise estimate.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Explains that Plan B requires more effort/resources to contact and survey individual students spread across many dormitories, which could be less practical or more time-consuming than surveying entire dorms.</li>
