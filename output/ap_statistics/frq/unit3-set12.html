      <div class="prompt">A school administrator wants to gather information about student opinions on a new bell schedule. There are 2000 students in the school, consisting of 500 freshmen, 500 sophomores, 500 juniors, and 500 seniors. The administrator plans to select a sample of 200 students.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Describe how the administrator could select a simple random sample of 200 students from the entire school population.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Describe how the administrator could select a stratified random sample of 200 students, ensuring representation from each grade level. Explain an advantage of using a stratified random sample over a simple random sample in this context.
      </div>

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Explains numbering all students (1-2000) and using a random number generator to select 200 unique numbers, corresponding to the students selected.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Explains dividing students into strata (grade levels), then taking a proportional simple random sample from each stratum (e.g., 50 from each grade). Explains the advantage of ensuring representation from each grade level, reducing variability, or allowing for comparisons between grades.</li>

      <h2>FRQ 2</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A local news station wants to conduct a survey to gauge public opinion on a proposed city tax increase. They decide to ask viewers to call a special phone number to register their opinion as "For" or "Against" the tax increase. The phone number is displayed on screen during their evening news broadcast.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Identify the sampling method used by the news station. Explain one potential source of bias in this sampling method.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Describe how this identified source of bias might affect the results of the survey with respect to the proposed tax increase.

      <div class="guidelines">
        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Identifies the sampling method as a voluntary response sample. Explains that a potential source of bias is that only individuals with strong opinions (either for or against) are likely to call in.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Describes that this bias might lead to an overrepresentation of extreme opinions, potentially overestimating or underestimating the true proportion of support for the tax increase compared to the general population.</li>

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Describe how the researchers could conduct an observational study to investigate this relationship.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Describe why an observational study, even if well-designed, cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship between coffee consumption and heart disease. Explain what type of study design would be needed to establish causation, if possible.
      </div>

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Describes selecting a sample of adults, collecting data on their daily coffee consumption habits and their incidence of heart disease over a period of time, without imposing any treatments.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Explains that observational studies cannot establish cause-and-effect relationships due to potential confounding variables that are not controlled or accounted for. Explains that a well-designed experiment with random assignment to different coffee consumption levels would be needed to establish causation.</li>

      <div class="prompt">A pharmaceutical company is testing a new medication designed to lower blood pressure. They have recruited 100 volunteers with high blood pressure. They plan to administer the new medication to some volunteers and a placebo to others, then measure the change in blood pressure after 8 weeks.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Identify the experimental units, the explanatory variable, and the response variable in this study.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Describe how the researchers could incorporate randomization into this experiment. Explain the purpose of randomization in this context.

      <div class="guidelines">
        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Identifies experimental units as the 100 volunteers, explanatory variable as the type of medication (new medication or placebo), and response variable as the change in blood pressure after 8 weeks.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Describes assigning volunteers to treatment groups (medication or placebo) using a random process (e.g., drawing names from a hat, random number generator). Explains that randomization helps to create groups that are roughly equivalent at the start of the experiment, minimizing the effects of lurking/confounding variables and allowing for a fair comparison of treatments.</li>

      <h2>FRQ 5</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A farmer wants to compare the effectiveness of two new fertilizers, Fertilizer A and Fertilizer B, on corn yield. They have 20 plots of land available, all similar in size but varying slightly in soil quality across the field.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Describe how the farmer could design a completely randomized experiment to compare the two fertilizers.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Describe how the farmer could design a randomized block experiment to compare the two fertilizers, using soil quality as the blocking variable. Explain an advantage of using a randomized block design over a completely randomized design in this context.
      </div>
       
      <div class="guidelines">
        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Describes randomly assigning each of the 20 plots to one of the two fertilizers (10 plots for A, 10 plots for B).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Describes grouping the 20 plots into blocks based on similar soil quality (e.g., 10 plots of high quality, 10 plots of low quality). Within each block, randomly assign half of the plots to Fertilizer A and the other half to Fertilizer B. Explains that blocking by soil quality helps to reduce variability within treatment groups that is due to soil differences, making it easier to detect a difference caused by the fertilizers.</li>
