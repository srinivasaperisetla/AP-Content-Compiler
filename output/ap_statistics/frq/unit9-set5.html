      <h2>FRQ 1</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A researcher wants to investigate the relationship between the number of hours students spend studying per week and their final exam scores in a challenging course. A random sample of 25 students from a large university was selected, and data on their study hours and exam scores were collected. A linear regression model was fitted to the data, and the least-squares regression line was $\hat{y} = 55 + 2.5x$, where $x$ is the study hours and $y$ is the exam score. The standard error of the slope, $SE_b$, was calculated to be $0.65$. The conditions for inference were checked and found to be met.</div>

      <h2>FRQ 3</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A study investigated the relationship between the number of minutes spent exercising daily and a person's systolic blood pressure reduction over a month. Data from 40 participants yielded a least-squares regression line of $\hat{y} = 10 - 0.25x$, where $x$ is daily exercise minutes and $y$ is blood pressure reduction. The standard error of the slope was $SE_b = 0.1$. The degrees of freedom for the test were $df=38$.</div>

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): Correctly calculates the test statistic: $t = \frac{b - \beta_0}{SE_b} = \frac{-0.25 - 0}{0.1} = -2.5$.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): Correctly interprets the p-value: If there were truly no linear relationship between daily exercise minutes and blood pressure reduction, there would be a 0.9% chance of observing a sample slope as extreme as or more extreme than -0.25 (or a test statistic as extreme as or more extreme than -2.5) by random chance.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Since the p-value ($0.009$) is less than $\alpha = 0.05$, we reject the null hypothesis. We have convincing evidence to conclude that there is a negative linear association between daily exercise minutes and blood pressure reduction.</li>

        The company claims that for every additional $1,000 spent on advertising, monthly sales increase by more than 0.5 thousand units on average. Based on the confidence interval from Data Set 2, justify whether this claim is supported.

        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): The confidence interval for Data Set 2 (sample size 50) is narrower than for Data Set 1 (sample size 20). This is because a larger sample size generally leads to a smaller standard error of the slope, resulting in a narrower confidence interval.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): The 95% confidence interval for the true slope from Data Set 2 is $(0.64, 0.96)$. Since all values in this interval are greater than 0.5, we have convincing evidence at the 95% confidence level that the true mean increase in sales for every additional $1,000$ spent on advertising is greater than 0.5 thousand units. Thus, the company's claim is supported.</li>
