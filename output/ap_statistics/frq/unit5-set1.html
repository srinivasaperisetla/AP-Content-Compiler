      <div class="prompt">A researcher wants to estimate the average height of adult trees in a large forest. They take a random sample of 5 trees and measure their heights in meters. The true average height of all trees in the forest is $\mu = 25$ meters. To understand the variability of different estimators, the researcher simulated taking 200 random samples of size 5 from this population and calculated three different estimators for each sample: 1. The sample mean: $\bar{x}$ 2. The sample median: $M$ 3. A custom estimator: $E = \text{Min} + \text{Max} - \frac{\text{Sum of middle 3}}{3}$ (where Min, Max are min/max heights in the sample) The means of the 200 calculated values for each estimator were: $\text{Mean}(\bar{x}) = 25.1$, $\text{Mean}(M) = 24.8$, $\text{Mean}(E) = 26.5$.</div>
