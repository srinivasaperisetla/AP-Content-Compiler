          <li>Part b (2pts): No, causation cannot be concluded because this is an observational study. There may be confounding variables (e.g., student motivation, socioeconomic status) that influence both extracurricular participation and academic performance.</li>

      <h2>FRQ 2</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A large university wants to survey its undergraduate students about their satisfaction with campus housing. There are 20,000 undergraduate students, distributed across four colleges: Arts & Sciences (8,000 students), Engineering (5,000 students), Business (4,000 students), and Education (3,000 students).</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Describe how to select a simple random sample (SRS) of 500 students from the university population.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Describe how to select a stratified random sample of 500 students, stratified by college. Explain why this method might be preferred over an SRS in this context.
      </div>
       
      <div class="guidelines">
        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Obtain a complete list of all 20,000 undergraduate students. Assign each student a unique number from 1 to 20,000. Use a random number generator to select 500 distinct numbers. The students corresponding to these numbers will be in the sample.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (3pts): Divide the population into four strata based on college. Calculate the proportion of students in each college (e.g., Arts & Sciences: $8000/20000 = 0.4$). Select a proportional number of students from each stratum using SRS (e.g., $0.4 \times 500 = 200$ from Arts & Sciences). This method ensures representation from each college, which is important if satisfaction levels might vary significantly by college, reducing variability in estimates compared to a simple random sample.</li>

      <h2>FRQ 3</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A city council wants to gauge public opinion on a new downtown development project. They decide to survey residents by setting up a booth at the entrance of the public library for one day and asking people leaving the library to participate.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Identify a potential source of bias in this sampling method.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Explain how this bias might affect the results of the survey with regard to the downtown development project.
      </div>
       
      <div class="guidelines">
        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): This is a convenience sample or volunteer sample. The sample will likely suffer from selection bias/undercoverage, as it only includes people who visit the public library.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): People who frequent the library may have different demographics, interests, or political views than the general city population. For example, they might be more educated, older, or have more time, which could make them more or less likely to support the development project. If library users are, for instance, generally more opposed to development (e.g., preferring quiet spaces), the survey results would overestimate the opposition to the project in the city.</li>

After two months, she measures the height of each plant.</div>

      <div class="prompt">A pharmaceutical company is testing a new drug designed to lower blood pressure. They have 100 volunteers with high blood pressure.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>

        Explain why blinding would be important in this experiment.

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (3pts): Randomly assign 50 volunteers to the treatment group and 50 to the control group. The treatment group receives the new drug, and the control group receives a placebo (control). All participants receive their assigned treatment for the same duration and under similar conditions (replication). The primary difference between groups should be the drug itself. The method of random assignment must be described (e.g., using a random number generator for each volunteer).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Blinding is important to prevent bias from the participants' expectations (placebo effect) and the researchers' observations. If participants know they are receiving the drug, their perceived improvement might influence their actual blood pressure or their reporting. If researchers know which participants received the drug, their measurements or evaluations could be subconsciously biased.</li>
