      <div class="prompt">A researcher wants to investigate the relationship between daily coffee consumption and sleep quality among adults aged 30-50. They recruit 500 adults, ask them to report their average daily coffee intake and rate their sleep quality on a scale of 1 to 10.</div>

      <h2>FRQ 5</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A pharmaceutical company conducts a double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment to test a new pain medication. 200 patients suffering from chronic back pain are randomly assigned to either receive the new medication or a placebo. After 8 weeks, the patients report their pain levels on a scale of 0 to 10 (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable). The mean decrease in pain for the medication group was 3.5 points, while for the placebo group it was 1.2 points. A statistical test indicated the difference was statistically significant ($p < 0.01$).</div>

       
      <div class="part">

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Identify one potential ethical concern regarding the placebo group in this study, and suggest a way to address it while maintaining experimental validity.

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): Interprets the $p$-value result, stating that there is strong evidence the new medication is more effective than the placebo in reducing chronic back pain for patients similar to those in the study.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): Explains that double-blinding prevents bias from patient expectations (placebo effect) and researcher influence, and placebo control provides a baseline for comparison, isolating the treatment effect.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Identifies a concern (e.g., withholding active treatment from patients in pain for an extended period) AND suggests a valid ethical adjustment (e.g., offering the medication to the placebo group after the study, using standard care as a control instead of a pure placebo).</li>
