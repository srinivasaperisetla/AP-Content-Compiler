      <div class="prompt">A school conducted a survey of its 200 students to gather data on their daily commute to school. For each student, they recorded their primary mode of transportation (e.g., walk, bus, car, bike) and their commute time in minutes.</div>

       
      <div class="part">

        Identify the types of variables collected in this survey (e.g., categorical or quantitative).

      <div class="part">

        A local transit authority claims that "the typical student commute time in this area is about 15 minutes, with most commutes falling between 10 and 20 minutes."

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>

          <li>Part d (1pt): Describes using parallel boxplots or comparative dot plots/histograms and explains looking for differences in center (median/mean), spread (IQR/range), and shape (skewness, outliers).</li>
          
          <li>Part e (1pt): Evaluates the claim by comparing the walking students' median and typical range (e.g., IQR) to the claim's values. For walking students, a median of 14 minutes is close to 15, and an IQR from say 10 to 19 minutes is consistent with "most commutes falling between 10 and 20 minutes". So, the claim appears reasonable for walking students.</li>
