      <div class="prompt">A school administrator wants to understand the sleep habits of high school students and how these habits might relate to academic performance. They decide to survey 200 students from the school's current enrollment.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Identify the type of study described. Justify your answer.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        The administrator sends an email to all 1500 students in the school inviting them to participate in an online survey. Identify a potential source of bias in this sampling method and explain how it might affect the results related to sleep habits.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Describe how the administrator could obtain a stratified random sample of 200 students based on grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th grade).

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): Identifies the study as an observational study and justifies it by stating no treatments were imposed.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Identifies voluntary response bias or undercoverage and explains that students with certain sleep habits (e.g., those who stay up late) might be more or less likely to respond, leading to an over/underestimation of average sleep.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Explains how to divide students into strata by grade level, calculate proportional sample sizes for each stratum, and then use a simple random sample within each stratum to select students.</li>

      <div class="prompt">A horticulturist wants to compare the effectiveness of two new organic fertilizers (Fertilizer A and Fertilizer B) on the growth of tomato plants. She has 30 young tomato plants of the same variety and size available for the study.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Identify the experimental units, the treatments, and the response variable in this experiment.

      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Explain why it is important to keep other conditions (e.g., amount of sunlight, water, soil type) consistent for all plants in this experiment.
      </div>
       
      <div class="guidelines">
        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1.5pts): Correctly identifies plants as experimental units, Fertilizer A and Fertilizer B as treatments, and plant growth (e.g., height, yield) as the response variable (0.5 pts each).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): Describes a valid randomization method, such as numbering plants $1-30$ and using a random number generator to assign 15 to Fertilizer A and the remaining 15 to Fertilizer B, or flipping a coin for each plant.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Explains that keeping other conditions consistent helps to ensure that any observed differences in plant growth are due to the fertilizers and not other confounding factors, thereby isolating the effect of the treatment.</li>

      <div class="prompt">A large urban high school with 2000 students wants to survey its students to gauge their opinions on a proposed change to the school's dress code policy. The student body is approximately 55% female and 45% male.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Describe how to select a simple random sample (SRS) of 100 students from the school.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Describe how to select a stratified random sample of 100 students, stratified by gender. Explain an advantage of using a stratified random sample over a simple random sample in this context.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Suppose the principal instead surveys the first 100 students who arrive at school on a given Monday morning. Identify the type of bias introduced by this sampling method and explain why it is a concern.
      </div>
       
      <div class="guidelines">
        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): Explains how to assign each student a unique number ($1-2000$) and use a random number generator to select 100 unique numbers, corresponding to the students selected for the sample.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Explains how to divide students into strata by gender (female/male), calculate proportional sample sizes ($100 \times 0.55 = 55$ female, $100 \times 0.45 = 45$ male), and then select an SRS within each stratum. Explains that stratification by gender ensures representation from both groups and may reduce variability in results if opinions on dress code differ by gender.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Identifies convenience sampling or selection bias. Explains that students who arrive early might have different opinions on the dress code than students who arrive later or are absent, leading to an unrepresentative sample.</li>

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Suppose researchers analyze existing medical records of 10,000 adults, categorizing them by their reported average daily coffee intake and tracking heart disease incidence. Identify the type of study described.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Explain why this type of study, as described in part (a), cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship between coffee consumption and heart disease. What conclusions, if any, can be drawn from such a study?
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Describe the key elements of a well-designed randomized experiment to investigate whether drinking coffee reduces the risk of heart disease. Include descriptions of how subjects would be assigned to treatment groups and how a control group would be used.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">d.</span>
        If the researchers believe that age might influence the effect of coffee on heart disease, explain how they could incorporate blocking into their experimental design and why this would be beneficial.

          <li>Part b (1.5pts): Explains that observational studies cannot establish causation due to potential confounding variables that are not controlled or measured. Concludes that only an association or correlation can be identified, not causation.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Describes random assignment of subjects to a coffee-drinking group and a placebo/no-coffee control group, ensuring subjects are blind to their treatment, and measuring heart disease incidence after a set period. (1pt for randomization and control, 1pt for key design elements like blinding/measurement).</li>
          
          <li>Part d (1pt): Explains how to divide subjects into age blocks (e.g., younger adults, middle-aged adults, older adults) and then randomly assign treatments within each block. Justifies that blocking by age helps reduce variability within treatment groups and allows for better detection of the treatment effect by accounting for age as a potential source of variation.</li>

      <h2>FRQ 5</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A pharmaceutical company conducts a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment to test a new medication designed to lower cholesterol levels. One hundred patients with high cholesterol are randomly assigned to receive either the new medication or a placebo for six months. At the end of the study, the change in cholesterol levels is measured for each patient.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Explain what "double-blind" means in the context of this experiment and why it is an important design feature.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Suppose the study found a "statistically significant" difference in cholesterol reduction between the medication group and the placebo group. Interpret what "statistically significant" means in this context.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Based on this well-designed experiment with a statistically significant result, what type of conclusion can the pharmaceutical company draw about the new medication and cholesterol levels?

      <div class="guidelines">
        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): Explains that neither the patients nor the researchers (or those administering the treatment/collecting data) know which treatment each patient is receiving. Justifies its importance by stating it minimizes bias from patient expectations (placebo effect) and researcher influence/observer bias.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): Interprets that a statistically significant difference means the observed difference in cholesterol reduction between the two groups is larger than what would reasonably be expected to occur by random chance if the medication had no effect. It suggests that the new medication is effective.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Concludes that because it was a well-designed, randomized experiment, and the result was statistically significant, the company can establish a cause-and-effect relationship: the new medication causes a reduction in cholesterol levels.</li>
