      <div class="prompt">A large urban high school with 2500 students wants to estimate the proportion of students who support a new school policy requiring uniforms. The principal proposes selecting 50 students from each of the four grade levels (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) and asking their opinion.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>

          <li>Part c (2pts): Identifies a relevant source of bias (e.g., convenience sample, response bias, early risers having different opinions) and explains how it would lead to an overestimation or underestimation of the true proportion of support for the policy.</li>

Their lead exposure levels are measured, and their average standardized test scores are recorded for the past three years. Researchers find a negative correlation between lead exposure and test scores.</td></tr><tr><td>Study B</td><td>In a different study, 200 children with similar academic histories are randomly assigned to two groups. One group lives in homes where environmental hazards (like lead paint) have been professionally removed, and the other group lives in homes where hazards remain.

      <div class="prompt">A research team wants to compare the effectiveness of two new dietary supplements (Supplement X and Supplement Y) on increasing muscle mass in adult males. They have 60 male volunteers. The researchers are concerned that age might influence muscle mass gain, with younger men potentially gaining muscle more easily than older men.</div>

       
      <div class="part">

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Describes forming blocks based on age (e.g., dividing volunteers into age groups like 20-30, 31-40, 41-50, etc.) and then randomly assigning an equal number of individuals from each block to Supplement X and Supplement Y.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): Explains that blocking by age helps to reduce variability within treatment groups and isolate the effect of the supplements by controlling for the known source of variation (age).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Compares the two designs, stating that blocking increases the precision of the comparison between supplements by reducing the effect of age confounding, whereas a completely randomized design might not balance age groups across treatments by chance, making it harder to determine if observed differences are due to supplements or age.</li>

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Interprets the numerical results by stating that, on average, Medication A resulted in a greater reduction in systolic blood pressure (by $15.2 - 12.1 = 3.1$ mmHg) compared to Medication B, and acknowledges that due to random assignment, this difference can be attributed to the medications.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Identifies a valid unanswered question, such as whether the difference is statistically significant, the long-term effects of the medications, potential side effects, the generalizability of results to other populations, or the practical significance of the $3.1$ mmHg difference.</li>
