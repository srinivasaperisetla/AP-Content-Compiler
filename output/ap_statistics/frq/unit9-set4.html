      <div class="prompt">A study investigated the relationship between the age of a car (in years) and its selling price (in thousands of dollars). A random sample of 20 cars was used. The least-squares regression line was $\hat{y} = 25.1 - 2.5x$, where $x$ is age and $y$ is selling price. The standard deviation of the residuals was $s_e = 3.2$. A plot of residuals versus fitted values showed a curved pattern.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>

      <h2>FRQ 3</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A car manufacturer claims that for every additional 100 pounds of weight added to a car, its fuel efficiency decreases by more than 0.5 miles per gallon (mpg). An independent consumer group conducted a study with a random sample of cars, fitting a linear regression model where $x$ is car weight (in hundreds of pounds) and $y$ is fuel efficiency (in mpg). The resulting 95% confidence interval for the true slope $\beta$ (change in mpg for each 100-pound increase) was $(-0.82, -0.48)$.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Based on the given 95% confidence interval, justify whether the consumer group has evidence to support the manufacturer's claim.

        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        If the consumer group were to increase their sample size from 20 to 50 cars, assuming the sample slope and standard deviation of residuals remained approximately the same, what effect would this likely have on the width of the confidence interval? Explain why.

(1pt).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): States that the width would decrease (1pt); Explains that increasing sample size increases degrees of freedom for the $t$-distribution, leading to a smaller critical $t$-value, and typically decreases the standard error of the slope, both contributing to a smaller margin of error (1pt).</li>
