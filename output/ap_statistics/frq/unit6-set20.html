      <h2>FRQ 5</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A local election for mayor is approaching, and a pollster wants to estimate the proportion of voters who support Candidate X. In a recent survey of 400 randomly selected likely voters, 210 indicated they would vote for Candidate X.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        A hypothesis test was conducted to determine if the true proportion of voters for Candidate X is greater than 0.50. The p-value for this test was 0.02. Interpret this p-value in the context of the problem.

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): Interprets p-value as the probability of observing a sample proportion as extreme as or more extreme than what was observed (210/400 = 0.525), assuming the true proportion of voters for Candidate X is 0.50 (or less than or equal to 0.50).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): States that increasing the sample size would decrease the width of the confidence interval. Explains that a larger sample size leads to a smaller standard error (denominator of margin of error), thus reducing the margin of error and the interval width.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Identifies this as a Type II error. Describes a consequence, such as Candidate X's campaign might scale back efforts believing they don't have enough support, or news outlets might report the election is too close to call when Candidate X is actually favored.</li>
