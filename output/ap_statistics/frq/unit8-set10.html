          <li>Part b (1.5pts): Verifies that random samples were taken for each bulb type (implies independence within and between groups) and that all expected counts are $\ge 5$. (Expected counts for defectives: $\frac{600 \times 30}{600} = 30$. Expected counts for non-defectives: $\frac{600 \times 570}{600} = 570$. All are $\ge 5$).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Interprets the p-value (0.0072) as the probability of observing a chi-square statistic as extreme or more extreme than 9.87, assuming the true proportion of defective bulbs is the same across all three types, in the context of bulb defects.</li>
          
          <li>Part d (1.5pts): Compares p-value to $\alpha$ ($0.0072 < 0.05$), rejects the null hypothesis, and justifies that there is convincing evidence that the proportion of defective bulbs is not the same across the LED, CFL, and Incandescent types.</li>
