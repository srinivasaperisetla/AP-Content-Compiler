      <h2>FRQ 5</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A school district is considering implementing a new after-school program. They want to know if students' interest in this program is dependent on their grade level (Middle School, High School). A survey was conducted with a random sample of 250 students, resulting in the following observed counts of interest (Interested, Not Interested).</div>

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        One of the conditions for performing this test is that all expected counts must be at least 5. Explain why this condition is important for the validity of the chi-square test.

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Suppose the calculated chi-square test statistic is $\chi^2 = 0.82$ with 1 degree of freedom. Determine the p-value. Based on this p-value, describe what this value suggests about the observed variation between interest levels across grade levels, particularly relating to the idea of "unexpected results" (VAR-1.J).

        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): Identifies Chi-Square Test for Independence. States correct null ($H_0$) and alternative ($H_a$) hypotheses in context: $H_0$: Student interest in the program is independent of grade level. $H_a$: Student interest in the program is dependent on grade level.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): Explains that the expected counts condition ensures the chi-square distribution is a good approximation for the sampling distribution of the test statistic. Small expected counts can lead to an inflated chi-square statistic and an inaccurate p-value, violating the assumption of a continuous distribution.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Determines the p-value for $\chi^2 = 0.82$ with $df=1$. Using a calculator, $p \approx 0.365$. Describes that this high p-value suggests that the observed differences in interest levels between middle and high school students are not statistically significant and could easily occur by random chance, meaning the results are not "unexpected" under the assumption of independence (ties to VAR-1.J).</li>
          
          <li>Part d (2pts): Critically evaluates the principal's statement, pointing out that failing to reject $H_0$ does not mean $H_0$ is true (i.e., "absolutely no difference"). Explains that a lack of evidence of difference is not evidence of a lack of difference. Provides an appropriate conclusion: "Since the p-value ($0.365$) is greater than $\alpha = 0.05$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not sufficient evidence to conclude that student interest in the program is dependent on grade level."</li>
