      <div class="prompt">A school counselor wants to investigate if a new SAT prep course improves scores. They enroll 100 students in the prep course and compare their post-course SAT scores to a group of 100 students who did not take the course. Both groups were chosen from the same grade level, and all students took the SAT at the same time.</div>

      <h2>FRQ 2</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A large university wants to survey its undergraduate students about their satisfaction with the campus dining services. The university has 30,000 undergraduate students, consisting of 8,000 freshmen, 7,500 sophomores, 7,500 juniors, and 7,000 seniors. The university wants to select a sample of 300 students.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Describe how to select a stratified random sample of 300 students, ensuring representation from each class level.

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Suppose the university instead sent an email to all 30,000 students asking them to complete an online survey if they wished. Identify a potential source of bias with this sampling method and explain how it could affect the results regarding dining satisfaction.

          <li>Part a (2pts): Correctly calculates sample sizes for each stratum (e.g., freshmen: $\frac{8000}{30000} \times 300 = 80$) AND describes a random selection process within each stratum (e.g., using a random number generator on a roster).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): Explains that stratification ensures representation from each class level, which could reduce variability or provide more precise estimates of satisfaction.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Identifies voluntary response bias OR undercoverage (if some students don't have email/internet) OR nonresponse bias (if few respond) AND explains how this bias might lead to overestimating or underestimating satisfaction (e.g., highly satisfied or highly dissatisfied students are more likely to respond).</li>

      <div class="prompt">A food scientist is investigating whether a new ingredient, "NutriBoost," can increase the average weight of eggs laid by hens. They have 60 hens available for the experiment.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Identify the experimental units, the treatment, and the response variable in this study.

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Describe how the food scientist could use a completely randomized design to assign the 60 hens to two groups (one receiving NutriBoost, one receiving a placebo) and how to ensure blinding for the hens' caretakers and the egg weighers.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">

        Explain why it is important to use a placebo and blinding in this experiment.

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>

          <li>Part b (2pts): Describes a valid randomization method for assigning hens to two groups of 30 (e.g., assign numbers 1-60, use a random number generator for 30 unique numbers, these hens get NutriBoost, others get placebo) AND describes how to implement blinding (e.g., supplement looks identical, caretakers/weighers unaware of which group received which).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Explains that a placebo controls for the placebo effect/psychological effects in the control group AND explains that blinding helps prevent bias from the expectations of the caretakers or researchers influencing the outcome.</li>

      <h2>FRQ 4</h2>

      <div class="prompt">Researchers are studying the effect of a new fertilizer (Fertilizer X) on the yield of a specific crop. They have 10 acres of land available, and each acre can be divided into 2 distinct plots.</div>

        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Describe a completely randomized experimental design for this study to compare Fertilizer X with a standard fertilizer (Fertilizer S). Include how treatments would be assigned and what would be measured.

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Describe a randomized block design for this study, treating each acre as a block, to compare Fertilizer X with Fertilizer S. Explain why a randomized block design might be preferred over a completely randomized design in this context.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Suppose the researchers conducted the randomized block design and found that Fertilizer X significantly increased yield compared to Fertilizer S within each block. Based on this, can they conclude that Fertilizer X *causes* an increase in crop yield for this specific crop? Justify your answer.

          <li>Part b (2pts): Describes randomly assigning Fertilizer X to one plot and Fertilizer S to the other plot *within each of the 10 acres* AND explains that blocking by acre reduces variability due to differences in soil conditions/other characteristics between acres, making it easier to detect the effect of the fertilizer.</li>

      <div class="part">

        If the researcher selects a random sample of adults, surveys them about their daily coffee consumption habits, and then monitors their heart health over a 10-year period without imposing any treatment, what type of study is this? Justify your answer.
