      <h2>FRQ 1</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A school administrator wants to estimate the proportion of students who support a new school policy. There are 2000 students in the school.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Describe how the administrator could use a simple random sample (SRS) of 100 students to gather data.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Identify one potential source of bias if the administrator only surveys students who attend an after-school club meeting about the policy.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Explain why using an SRS would be preferable to surveying only students at the after-school club meeting.

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Explains a valid method for SRS (e.g., assign numbers 1-2000 to students, use a random number generator to select 100 unique numbers, then survey those students).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): Identifies a valid bias (e.g., selection bias, nonresponse bias, undercoverage bias, voluntary response bias) and explains how students at the club might not represent all students.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Explains that an SRS helps ensure the sample is representative of the entire student body, reducing bias, unlike surveying only club attendees who are likely not representative.</li>

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>

          <li>Part b (2pts): Describes a controlled experiment (e.g., randomly assign participants to different coffee consumption groups, control other variables, and measure heart disease incidence).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Explains that a cause-and-effect conclusion cannot be established from an observational study because confounding variables cannot be controlled for, only an association can be shown.</li>

      <div class="part">

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>

          <li>Part b (2pts): Explains that blinding helps prevent bias in the perception of effectiveness by participants and/or evaluators (e.g., placebo effect, researcher bias).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Proposes a valid randomization method (e.g., assign each volunteer a unique number 1-120, use a random number generator to select 60 numbers for the new medication group; the remaining 60 go to the existing medication group).</li>

      <h2>FRQ 5</h2>

      <div class="prompt">In a randomized controlled experiment, 100 patients with a certain disease were randomly assigned to two groups: Group A received a new drug, and Group B received a placebo. After six months, 70% of patients in Group A showed improvement, while 40% of patients in Group B showed improvement. The difference was found to be statistically significant.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Interpret the meaning of "statistically significant" in the context of this experiment.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Based on these results, can it be concluded that the new drug causes improvement in patients with this disease? Justify your answer.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Identify a potential confounding variable that this experiment effectively controlled for through its design.
      </div>
       
      <div class="guidelines">
        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): Interprets "statistically significant" as the observed difference (70% vs. 40%) is unlikely to have occurred by random chance if the drug had no effect.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Concludes that causation can be established because it was a well-designed, randomized experiment, which helps control for confounding variables, allowing for cause-and-effect conclusions.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Identifies a valid confounding variable (e.g., severity of disease, age, lifestyle, other medications) that randomization would tend to balance across groups.</li>
