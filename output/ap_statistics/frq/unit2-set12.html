          <li>Part c (2pts): Describes a non-linear relationship (e.g., quadratic where more study helps up to a point, then too much study decreases scores due to exhaustion or poor allocation of time, or simply a curved pattern) where a straight line would not fit well, leading to a low linear correlation.</li>
