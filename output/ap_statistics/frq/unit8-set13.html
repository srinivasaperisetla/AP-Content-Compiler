          <li>Part c (2pts): Calculates all expected counts correctly (e.g., $E_{Saw,Donated} = \frac{300 \times 150}{500} = 90$) AND calculates the $\chi^2$ test statistic showing components: $\chi^2 = \frac{(120-90)^2}{90} + \frac{(180-210)^2}{210} + \frac{(30-60)^2}{60} + \frac{(170-140)^2}{140} \approx 35.71$.</li>
          
          <li>Part d (1pt): Correctly interprets the p-value (e.g., "If there were no association between seeing the campaign and donating, the probability of observing a chi-square statistic as large as 35.71 or larger by chance is $0.0001$.") in context.</li>
