      <h2>FRQ 3</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A agricultural researcher wants to compare the effectiveness of two different fertilizers, Fertilizer A and Fertilizer B, on crop yield. She decides to use a paired design by applying both fertilizers to adjacent plots within 12 different farms. The researcher records the yield (in bushels per acre) for each fertilizer on each farm. For each farm, the difference in yield, Fertilizer A - Fertilizer B, was calculated. The mean difference was $\bar{x}_d = 3.5$ bushels per acre with a standard deviation of the differences $s_d = 2.1$ bushels per acre.
