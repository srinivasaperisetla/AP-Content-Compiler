      <h2>FRQ 1</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A researcher wants to investigate if consuming organic vegetables is associated with a lower risk of heart disease in adults. They recruit 1,000 adults and collect data on their typical dietary habits (including organic vegetable consumption) and their medical history regarding heart disease.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Identify the primary research question this study aims to answer regarding data collection methods.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Identify the type of study described.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Explain why this type of study is appropriate for investigating the association between organic vegetable consumption and heart disease risk.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">d.</span>
        Based on this study, can the researchers conclude that consuming organic vegetables causes a lower risk of heart disease? Justify your answer.

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): Identifies a valid question, e.g., "Is there an association between consuming organic vegetables and the risk of heart disease in adults?" or "Do adults who consume organic vegetables have a lower risk of heart disease?".</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): Identifies the study as an observational study.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Explains that it's appropriate because it allows for studying existing habits/conditions without intervention, or because it's unethical/ impractical to assign diets experimentally.</li>
          
          <li>Part d (2pts): States no, and justifies that observational studies can only show association, not causation, due to potential confounding variables.</li>

      <div class="prompt">A school principal wants to survey students' opinions on a new bell schedule. There are 1,500 students in the school, distributed across grades 9-12.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Describe how the principal could use simple random sampling to select 150 students for the survey.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Describe how the principal could use stratified random sampling to select 150 students, ensuring representation from each grade level.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Explain why stratified random sampling might be more appropriate than simple random sampling in this situation.

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): Describes assigning a unique number to each student and using a random number generator to select 150 students (or equivalent method).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Describes dividing students into strata by grade (9, 10, 11, 12) and then selecting a proportional random sample from each stratum (or equal number if total N is not specified for each stratum).</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Explains that stratified random sampling ensures representation from each grade level, which might have different opinions on the bell schedule, reducing variability in estimates.</li>

      <div class="prompt">A town council wants to gauge public opinion on a proposed new public park. They decide to conduct a survey by publishing a questionnaire in the local newspaper and asking interested residents to mail back their responses.</div>

        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Identify one potential source of bias in this sampling method.

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>

          <li>Part b (1pt): Explains that people with strong opinions (either positive or negative) are more likely to respond, or that certain demographics are underrepresented, leading to an overestimation/underestimation of support for the park.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Suggests an appropriate random sampling method, such as simple random sampling of registered voters, systematic sampling of households, or a stratified sample based on geographic regions.</li>

      <div class="prompt">A pharmaceutical company is testing a new drug designed to lower cholesterol. They recruit 200 volunteers with high cholesterol and randomly assign them to one of two groups. Group A receives the new drug, and Group B receives a placebo. After 3 months, the cholesterol levels of all participants are measured and compared.</div>

      <div class="prompt">A researcher wants to compare the effectiveness of two different fertilizers (Fertilizer A and Fertilizer B) on the growth of a specific type of plant. They have 60 identical plant seedlings and 30 pots available for the experiment.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Describe a completely randomized design for this experiment. Include how treatments would be assigned and explain how confounding variables would be addressed.

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Propose an improvement to the design described in part (a) if the researcher suspects that the location of the pots in the greenhouse (e.g., closer to a window vs. further) might affect plant growth.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        Explain how your proposed design in part (b) addresses the potential confounding variable of pot location.

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Describes randomly assigning 30 plants to Fertilizer A and 30 plants to Fertilizer B (or similar equal split) and applying the respective fertilizers. Explains that randomization helps balance out unknown confounding variables across groups.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): Proposes a block design where plants are grouped into blocks based on location (e.g., 'window-side' vs. 'interior'). Within each block, plants are randomly assigned to Fertilizer A or Fertilizer B.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Explains that blocking by location ensures that both fertilizers are tested under similar light/temperature conditions, isolating the effect of the fertilizer itself within each block.</li>
