          <li>Part b (1pt): Calculates $E(X) = \frac{1}{p} = \frac{1}{0.03} \approx 33.33$ chips.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Explains setting up a simulation using random numbers. Assigns 01-03 as a defective chip and 04-100 as a non-defective chip. Generates random numbers until a defective chip is found, records the number of non-defective chips before the first defective. Repeats many times. States to count how often the number of non-defective chips (or total chips) is less than or equal to 3. Alternatively, assigns 1-3 as defective and 4-100 as non-defective, generates random integers from 1 to 100, and records the trial number where the first defective (1-3) occurs. Repeats many times, then calculates the proportion of trials where the first defective occurred on trial 1, 2, or 3.</li>
          
          <li>Part d (2pts): Calculates $P(X \ge 20) = (1-0.03)^{19} = (0.97)^{19} \approx 0.547$. Explains that finding the first defective chip on the 20th chip tested is not unusual (since $P(X \ge 20)$ is high), so this result does not necessarily suggest that the historical defect rate of 3% is incorrect. (Alternatively, $P(X=20) = (0.97)^{19}(0.03) \approx 0.0164$, which is small, but cumulative probability is better for "suggests".)</li>

          <li>Part c (2pts): Explains that the mean would remain the same, as the linearity property of expectation does not depend on independence: $E(B+P) = E(B) + E(P)$. Explains that the standard deviation (or variance) would increase if they are positively correlated, because $Var(B+P) = Var(B) + Var(P) + 2Cov(B,P)$, and $Cov(B,P) > 0$ for positive correlation.</li>
