      <h2>FRQ 1</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A company produces a new brand of energy-efficient light bulbs. Researchers want to investigate the relationship between the number of hours a bulb is used per day and its lifespan in months. They collected data from a random sample of 25 bulbs and fit a linear regression model. The regression output reported a sample slope of $\hat{b} = -0.55$ months per hour, with a standard error of $SE_{\hat{b}} = 0.12$ months per hour. The average daily usage ranged from 2 to 10 hours. A scatterplot of the data showed a linear pattern, and a residuals plot showed no obvious pattern.</div>

      <h2>FRQ 4</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A forester is studying the relationship between the age of a certain type of tree (in years) and its diameter at breast height (DBH, in inches). Data were collected from 20 trees. The least-squares regression line for predicting DBH from age is $\widehat{DBH} = 2.5 + 0.6(\text{Age})$. The 95% confidence interval for the true slope of the regression line is $(0.48, 0.72)$. A scatterplot of the data shows a clear positive linear association, but with increasing variability in DBH as age increases.</div>

Since the entire interval (4.8 to 7.2 inches) includes values less than 6 inches, the claim that the DBH increases by *at least* 6 inches is not fully supported, because it is plausible for the increase to be less than 6 inches (1pt).</li>
