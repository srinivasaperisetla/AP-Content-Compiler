      <h2>FRQ 1</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A researcher wants to investigate if there is a linear relationship between the number of hours a student studies for a statistics exam and their score on the exam. A random sample of 30 students yields a least-squares regression line $\hat{y} = 45 + 5x$, where $x$ is the study hours and $y$ is the exam score. The standard error of the slope coefficient is $SE_b = 0.95$, and the standard deviation of the residuals is $s_e = 7.2$.</div>

          <li>Part b (2pts): Shows correct calculation of the degrees of freedom ($df=28$) and the critical t-value ($t^* \approx 2.048$), then calculates the confidence interval using the formula $b \pm t^*SE_b$ (e.g., $5 \pm 2.048(0.95) \Rightarrow (3.05, 6.95)$).</li>

      <h2>FRQ 2</h2>

      <div class="prompt">An agricultural researcher wants to model the relationship between the amount of a new organic fertilizer (in kilograms per plot) and the yield of a certain crop (in bushels per plot). Data were collected from 25 randomly selected plots of land, and a least-squares regression line was calculated. The residual plot showed no apparent pattern and the residuals appeared to be normally distributed when viewed in a histogram. However, the scatterplot of yield versus fertilizer amount showed some increase in variability of yield as the amount of fertilizer increased.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Verify the conditions for performing a significance test for the slope of the population regression line based on the given information. Clearly state which conditions are met, which are not, and why.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        The least-squares regression line was $\hat{y} = 50 + 2.5x$, where $x$ is the fertilizer amount and $y$ is the crop yield. The standard error of the slope coefficient was $SE_b = 0.8$. Calculate the test statistic for determining if there is a positive linear relationship between fertilizer amount and crop yield.
      </div>
       
      <div class="guidelines">
        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (2pts): Identifies and verifies the Independence (random selection) and Normality (residuals appear normal) conditions as met. Identifies and explains that the Equal Variance condition is violated due to increasing variability in the scatterplot, which makes inference less reliable, and therefore, the conditions for inference are not fully met.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): States the null hypothesis $H_0: \beta = 0$ (or similar) and the alternative hypothesis $H_a: \beta > 0$. Shows correct calculation of the test statistic: $t = \frac{b - \beta_0}{SE_b} = \frac{2.5 - 0}{0.8} = 3.125$.</li>

      <h2>FRQ 3</h2>

      <div class="prompt">A biologist is studying the relationship between the age of a certain species of tree (in years) and its height (in meters). For a random sample of 40 trees, a $95\%$ confidence interval for the slope of the population regression line relating height to age was calculated as $(0.15, 0.23)$. A colleague performs a similar study with a random sample of 100 trees and calculates a new $95\%$ confidence interval for the slope.</div>

       
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Interpret the $95\%$ confidence interval $(0.15, 0.23)$ in the context of this study.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Explain how increasing the sample size from 40 to 100 trees would affect the width of the $95\%$ confidence interval for the slope, assuming all other factors remain constant.
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">c.</span>
        The biologist claims that, on average, for every additional year a tree ages, its height increases by more than $0.1$ meters. Using the confidence interval $(0.15, 0.23)$, justify whether this claim is supported.

          <li>Part b (1pt): Explains that a larger sample size ($n=100$) will lead to a smaller standard error for the slope ($SE_b$), which will result in a narrower confidence interval.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): States that since the entire interval $(0.15, 0.23)$ is above $0.1$, there is convincing evidence to support the claim that the true mean increase in height is more than $0.1$ meters per year of age.</li>
