A random sample of houses sold in a particular neighborhood yielded the least-squares regression line $\hat{y} = 50,000 + 75x$, where $x$ is the size of the house in square feet and $\hat{y}$ is the predicted selling price in dollars.

      <div class="prompt">A company investigates the relationship between its advertising expenditure (in thousands of dollars) and its monthly sales (in thousands of dollars). Data for 11 months are collected and plotted in a scatterplot. One month had an exceptionally high advertising expenditure and high sales compared to the other months.</div>

        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        On a scatterplot, describe the characteristics of a point that would be considered an influential point.

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>
        Suppose the point representing the month with exceptionally high advertising expenditure and high sales is $(50, 400)$ while most other points are clustered between advertising expenditure of $5$ to $15$ and sales of $100$ to $150$.

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): Describes an influential point as one that, if removed, would significantly change the slope and/or $y$-intercept of the least-squares regression line. Often has a large $x$-value (high leverage).</li>
          
          <li>Part b (2pts): States that removing the point $(50, 400)$ would likely decrease the slope and increase the correlation coefficient. Justifies that the point pulls the line towards itself, making the slope steeper, and its removal would make the remaining points show a stronger linear relationship since it's far out in $x$ and aligned with the trend.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Explains that an outlier in the $y$-direction (large residual) has a large vertical distance from the line but may not significantly change the slope if its $x$-value is near the mean. An influential point has an extreme $x$-value (high leverage) and may or may not have a large residual, but its removal significantly changes the line's slope and/or intercept.</li>

      <div class="prompt">A researcher is studying the decay of a radioactive substance. The initial amount of the substance is 100 grams. The amount remaining (in grams) is measured at various times (in hours). A scatterplot of the amount remaining versus time shows a curved, decreasing pattern, indicating a nonlinear relationship. To linearize the relationship, the natural logarithm of the amount remaining was taken. The least-squares regression line for $\ln(\text{amount})$ versus time is $\widehat{\ln(\text{amount})} = 4.60 - 0.15(\text{time})$.</div>

       
      <div class="part">

      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">b.</span>

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>

          <li>Part b (1pt): Explains that a linear relationship in the transformed data, combined with random scatter in the residual plot, indicates that the original relationship can be modeled by an exponential function, which is linearized by the log transformation.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Calculates $\widehat{\ln(\text{amount})} = 4.60 - 0.15(10) = 4.60 - 1.50 = 3.10$. Then exponentiates to find the predicted amount: $\text{amount} = e^{3.10} \approx 22.198$ grams. Shows both steps.</li>
