      <div class="part">
        <span class="part-label">a.</span>
        Describe how increasing the sample size from $n=15$ to $n=30$ (while keeping other statistics, like the sample slope and standard error of the slope, approximately constant) would affect the width of a 95% confidence interval for the true slope of the regression line. Justify your answer.

          <li>Part a (1pt): (1/2pt) States that the width of the confidence interval would decrease. (1/2pt) Justifies by explaining that a larger sample size leads to more degrees of freedom, which results in a smaller critical $t^*$ value, and/or a smaller standard error for the slope, both of which reduce the margin of error and thus the interval width.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): Explains that the t-distribution used for inference on the slope relies on the assumption of normal residuals for its validity, especially for smaller sample sizes.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Explains that a scatterplot should show a roughly linear pattern without obvious curvature, indicating that a linear model is appropriate.</li>
