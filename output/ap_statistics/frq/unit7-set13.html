      <div class="prompt">A local farm is experimenting with a new organic pesticide to control aphids. To determine if the new pesticide is more effective than their current conventional pesticide, they select 12 plots of land. Each plot is divided into two equal sections. One section is treated with the new organic pesticide, and the other section is treated with the current conventional pesticide. The number of aphids remaining after one week is recorded for each section.</div>

        The mean difference (Conventional - Organic) in the number of aphids for the 12 plots was $4.5$ aphids with a standard deviation of $3.0$ aphids. A $t$-test yielded a $p$-value of $0.0003$.

          <li>Part c (1pt): Justifies that since the entire interval $(0.74, 6.46)$ is above zero (it does not contain 0), there is convincing evidence of a significant difference in mean math scores at $\alpha = 0.05$ (1pt).</li>
