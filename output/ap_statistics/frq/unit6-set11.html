For 95% CI, $z^* \approx 1.96$. CI = $0.42 \pm 1.96(0.0219) = 0.42 \pm 0.0429 \Rightarrow (0.3771, 0.4629)$.</li>

        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): States correct hypotheses: $H_0: p = 0.75$ versus $H_a: p < 0.75$, where $p$ is the true proportion of light bulbs that last longer than 10,000 hours.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): Verifies all three conditions (Random, 10% rule, Large Counts) with appropriate calculations/justifications. Random: Stated random sample. 10% rule: $200 < 10\%$ of all new eco-friendly light bulbs. Large Counts: $np_0 = 200(0.75) = 150 \ge 10$ and $n(1-p_0) = 200(0.25) = 50 \ge 10$.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Calculates the test statistic and p-value. $\hat{p} = 140/200 = 0.70$. Test statistic $z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}} = \frac{0.70 - 0.75}{\sqrt{\frac{0.75(0.25)}{200}}} \approx -1.634$. P-value = $P(Z < -1.634) \approx 0.0511$.</li>
          
          <li>Part d (1pt): Interprets the p-value. Assuming the true proportion of light bulbs lasting over 10,000 hours is 0.75, there is approximately a 0.0511 probability of observing a sample proportion of 0.70 or less in a random sample of 200 light bulbs.</li>
          
          <li>Part e (1pt): States correct conclusion and justification. Since the p-value ($0.0511$) is greater than $\alpha = 0.05$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

Independence within groups: Patients within each group are independent. Independence between groups: Medication A and B groups are independent. 10% rule: $300 < 10\%$ of all potential patients for Med A; $350 < 10\%$ of all potential patients for Med B.

Standard error $SE = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_A(1-\hat{p}_A)}{n_A} + \frac{\hat{p}_B(1-\hat{p}_B)}{n_B}} \approx 0.03287$. For 90% CI, $z^* \approx 1.645$. CI = $0.05714 \pm 1.645(0.03287) = 0.05714 \pm 0.05406 \Rightarrow (0.00308, 0.11120)$.</li>

          <li>Part a (1pt): States correct hypotheses and defines parameters. Let $p_1$ be the true proportion of students reading at or above grade level before the program, and $p_2$ be the true proportion after the program. $H_0: p_1 = p_2$ versus $H_a: p_1 < p_2$.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): Verifies all conditions for a two-sample proportion z-test. Random: Stated random samples. Independence within groups: Students within each sample are independent. Independence between groups: Samples are of different students. 10% rule: $250 < 10\%$ of all students before; $300 < 10\%$ of all students after. Large Counts: Before: $n_1\hat{p}_1 = 175 \ge 10$, $n_1(1-\hat{p}_1) = 75 \ge 10$. After: $n_2\hat{p}_2 = 234 \ge 10$, $n_2(1-\hat{p}_2) = 66 \ge 10$.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (2pts): Calculates test statistic and p-value. $\hat{p}_1 = 175/250 = 0.70$. $\hat{p}_2 = 234/300 = 0.78$. Pooled proportion $\hat{p}_c = \frac{175+234}{250+300} = \frac{409}{550} \approx 0.7436$. Test statistic $z = \frac{(\hat{p}_2 - \hat{p}_1) - 0}{\sqrt{\hat{p}_c(1-\hat{p}_c)(\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2})}} \approx 2.140$. P-value = $P(Z > 2.140) \approx 0.0162$.</li>
          
          <li>Part d (1pt): Interprets the p-value. Assuming there is no difference in the true proportion of students reading at or above grade level before and after the program, there is approximately a 0.0162 probability of observing a difference in sample proportions as large as or larger than 0.08 in favor of the new program due to random chance.</li>

      <div class="prompt">A national survey aims to estimate the proportion of U.S. adults who support a new environmental policy. They want to construct a 99 percent confidence interval with a margin of error of no more than 3 percentage points. A pilot study suggests the true proportion is around 55 percent.</div>

        Explain how increasing the confidence level from 90 percent to 99 percent would affect the width of a confidence interval, assuming the sample size and sample proportion remain the same. (Do not calculate.)

        <h3>Scoring Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Part a (1pt): Correctly calculates minimum sample size. $ME = z^*\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$. For 99% CI, $z^* \approx 2.576$. $0.03 = 2.576\sqrt{\frac{0.55(0.45)}{n}}$. Solving for $n$, $n \approx 1825.22$. Round up to $1826$.</li>
          
          <li>Part b (1pt): Explains the effect on width. Increasing the confidence level from 90 percent to 99 percent would increase the width of the confidence interval. This is because a higher confidence level requires a larger critical value ($z^*$), which in turn increases the margin of error and thus the width of the interval, to capture the true parameter with greater certainty.</li>
          
          <li>Part c (1pt): Describes a Type I error in context. A Type I error would occur if the survey concludes that a majority of U.S. adults support the new environmental policy ($H_a: p > 0.50$), when in reality, the true proportion of support is 50% or less ($H_0: p = 0.50$).</li>
          
          <li>Part d (1pt): Interprets the consequence of a Type I error in the context of this environmental policy. The consequence of a Type I error here would be that resources might be allocated to promote a policy based on the mistaken belief that it has majority public support, potentially leading to misallocation of efforts or public backlash if actual support is lower.</li>
