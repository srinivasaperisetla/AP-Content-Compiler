      A manufacturer claims that its light bulbs have a mean lifetime of at least 1,200 hours. A consumer advocacy group tests this claim by selecting a random sample of 36 light bulbs. The sample has a mean lifetime of 1,175 hours and a sample standard deviation of 90 hours. To test the hypotheses H₀: μ = 1,200 versus Hₐ: μ < 1,200, where μ is the true mean lifetime of the bulbs, what is the value of the test statistic?
