      A chi-square test for independence is conducted on data from a single random sample of high school students, measuring their grade level (9, 10, 11, 12) and their primary mode of transportation to school (Bus, Car, Walk, Other). The test results in a test statistic of χ² = 15.62 with a corresponding p-value of 0.016.
