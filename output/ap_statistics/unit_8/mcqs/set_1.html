      A sociologist investigated whether there is an association between level of education (High School, Bachelor's, Graduate) and opinion on a public policy issue (Favor, Oppose, Neutral) for adults in a certain city. A chi-square test for independence was conducted on data from a random sample of adults. The test resulted in a test statistic of χ² = 10.83 with 4 degrees of freedom, yielding a p-value of 0.028.
